###Article 4

### *Procedure Concerning Modifications to the Plan* 

4.1 *Modifications to the Plan* When an administration proposes to make a modification to the Plan, i.e.: - to modify the characteristics of a frequency assignment to a sound broadcasting station shown in the Plan, whether or not the station has been brought into use; or - to bring into use an assignment to a sound broadcasting station not appearing in the Plan; or - to modify the characteristics of a frequency assignment to a sound broadcasting station for which the procedure in this Article has been successfully applied, whether or not the station has been brought into use, or - to cancel a frequency assignment to a sound broadcasting station, the procedure contained in this Article shall be applied before any notification is made under Article 7 of this Agreement. 4.2 *Initiation of the modification procedure* 4.2.1 Any administration proposing to modify the characteristics of an assignment appearing in the Plan or to add a new assignment to the Plan shall obtain the agreement of any other administration whose services are likely to be affected. 4.2.2 a. The sound broadcasting stations of an administration are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the distance from the station under consideration to the nearest point on the boundary of the country of that administration is less than the limit indicated in Annex 4, Chapter 1. 4.2.2 b. The television stations of an administration in the band 87.5-100 MHz which are in conformity with the Stockholm Agreement (1961) are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the distance from the station under consideration to the nearest point on the boundary of the country of that administration is less than the limit indicated in Annex 4, Chapter 2. 4.2.2 c. The stations in the fixed and mobile services of an administration of a Contracting Member in Region 3 in the band 87.5-100 MHz are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the appropriate limits indicated in Annex 4, Chapters 4 and 5, are exceeded. 4.2.2 d. The stations in the land mobile service of an administration in Region 1 in the band 87.5-88 MHz, coordinated under Article 14 of the Radio Regulations, are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the limits indicated in Annex 4, Chapter 4, are exceeded. 4.2.2 e. The stations of the fixed and mobile services, except the aeronautical mobile (R) service, of an administration in Region 1, operating in the band 104-108 MHz in conformity with the Radio Regulations on a permitted basis until 31 December 1995, are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the appropriate limits indicated in Annex 4, Chapters 4, 5 and 6, are exceeded. 4.2.2 f. The stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service of an administration in the band 108-117.975 MHz are likely to be affected by a proposed modification to the Plan if the distance from the station under consideration to the nearest point on the boundary of the country of that administration is less than the limit indicated in Annex 4, Chapter 3. In this case, the procedure to be applied is contained in Article 5. 4.2.3 Administrations shall seek the agreement of other administrations preferably directly or, when this is not possible, by applying the procedure contained in this article. 4.2.4 The agreement mentioned in section 4.2.1 is not required if: a. the proposed modification relates to a reduction in effective radiated power or to other changes which would not increase the level of interference to services of other countries; or b. the distances from the station under consideration to the nearest points on the boundaries of other countries, the administrations of which are Contracting Members, are equal to or greater than the limits indicated in Annex 4; or c. the proposed modification relates to a change in the site of the station and the distance between the actual site of the transmitter and the site indicated in the Plan is no greater than: - 1,5 km for transmitters having a total e.r.p. greater or equal than 1 kW; - 5 km for transmitters having a total e.r.p. less than 1 kW; provided that the change in topographical conditions does not increase the probability of interference caused to the stations of other countries. 4.2.5 An administration proposing to modify the Plan shall communicate to the IFRB the information listed in Annex 3 and shall also indicate, if appropriate: a. that the agreement referred to in section 4.2.1 is not required with any administration; or b. the name of any administration which has already agreed to the modification proposed on the basis of the characteristics communicated to the IFRB. 4.2.6 When requesting the agreement of another administration, the administration proposing to modify the Plan may also communicate any additional information relating to proposed methods and criteria to be used as well as other details concerning the terrain, particular propagation conditions, etc. (see also Annex 5). 4.2.7 On receipt of the information referred to in section 4.2.5 above, the IFRB shall: a. identify the administration whose services are likely to be affected in conformity with sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.4; b. send immediately a telex to those administrations identified in a. above which have not yet given their agreement, drawing their attention to the information contained in the special section of a forthcoming weekly circular and indicating the nature of the modification to the Plan; c. publish the information received in the special section of this weekly circular, together with the names of the administrations identified, indicating those whose agreement has been obtained. 4.3 *Consultation of the administrations whose stations may be affected* 4.3.1 The special section of the IFRB weekly circular, reffered to in 4.2.7 c, constitutes the formal request for agreement addressed to those administrations whose agreement remains to be obtained. 4.3.2 Any administration which considers that it should have been included in the list of administrations whose frequency assignments are likely to be affected may, within 28 days from the date of publication of the weekly circular, request the IFRB by telex to include its name. A copy of the request shall be sent to the administration proposing the modification to the Plan. 4.3.3 On receipt of the telex, the IFRB shall consider the matter and, if it finds that the name of this administration should have been included in the list, it shall: - inform the administrations concerned by telex; and - publish the name of the administration in an addendum to the special section of the weekly circular referred to its 4.2.7 c. For this administration, the overall period of 100 days specified in section 4.3.10 shall run from the date of publication of the addendum to the special section of the weekly circular referred to above. 4.3.4 An administration receiving a telex from the IFRB sent in accordance with sections 4.2.7 or 4.3.3 above shall acknowledge receipt within 50 days. 4.3.5 If the IFRB has not received an acknowledgement after 50 days, it shall send a reminder telex and inform the administration that, if no reply is received within 10 days, it will be deemed to have received the request for agreement. 4.3.6 On receipt of the special section of the IFRB weekly circular referred to in sections 4.2.7 c. and 4.3.3, any administration listed therein shall determine the effect produced on its assignments by the proposed modification to the Plan, using any of the additional information referred to in section 4.2.6 which it finds acceptable. 4.3.7 If the administration consulted is responsible for: 4.3.7.1 a sound broadcasting station, it should normally accept the proposed modification provided that: - the resulting usable field strength is not greater than 54dB (μV/m); or - the resulting usable field strength is greater than 54 dB (μV/m), but is increased by 0.5 dB or less compared with the reference usable field strength. An increase of more than 0.5 dB is open to negotiations, in which more detailed calculation methods may be used. The values referred to above shall be calculated by the method contained in Annex 2, Chapter 4, at the transmitter site or at specific points of the service area of the stations which are likely to be affected. The reference usable field strength of an assignment to be protected is the field strength which results from the Plan adopted by the Conference or, for an assignment entered in the Plan after the Conference following the application of this procedure, the field strength which results from the Plan at the time this assignments was first recorded in the Plan. If, due to deletions or modifications, the usable field strength becomes lower, then this lower value becomes the new reference usable field strength. The actual geographical conditions should be taken into account, whenever practicable. 4.3.7.2 a television station, it should normally accept an increase in the usable field strength at the transmitter site, provided that: - the resulting usable field strength is not greater than 52 dB (μV/m), or - the resulting usable field strength is greater than 52 dB (μV/m), but is increased by 0.5 dB or less compared with the usable field strength resulting from the Plan adopted by the Conference and from the television stations in accordance with the Stockholm Agreement at the date of the Conference. An increase of more than 0.5 dB is open to negotiations, in which more detailed calculation methods may be used. 4.3.7.3 a station in the mobile, except aeronautical mobile (OR), service in Region 3 in the frequency band 87.5-100 MHz, it should normally accept the following interfering field strength: - 18 dB (μV/m) if the sound broadcasting station uses horizontal polarization; - 0 dB (μV/m) if the sound broadcasting station uses vertical or mixed polarization. In the case of mixed polarization, only the vertical component of the total effective radiated power of the sound broadcasting station should be taken into account if at least one-tenth of the total effective radiated power is radiated in the vertical component. These limits apply when the frequency of the sound broadcasting station coincides with the frequency of the station of the mobile service. If they do not coincide, an appropriate allowance should be made (see Annex 5, Chapter 2). The interfering field strengths are calculated using the method contained in Annex 4, Chapter 4 at 10 m above ground at the site of the base station assuming the use of vertical polarization. 4.3.7.4 a station in the fixed service, it should normally accept an interfering field strength of 0dB (μV/m) at 10m above ground, calculated in accordance with the method in Annex 4, Chapter 5. This limit applies when the frequency of the sound broadcasting station coincides with the frequency of the station of the fixed service. If they do not coincide, an appropriate allowance should be made (see Annex 5, Chapter 2). 4.3.7.5 a station in the land mobile service in Region 1 in the band 87.5-88 MHz, it should normally accept the following interfering field strengths: - 14 dB (μV/m) for mobile stations using amplitude modulation if the sound broadcasting station uses horizontal polarization; - 24 dB (μV/m) for mobile stations using frequency modulation if the sound broadcasting station uses horizontal polarization; - 6 dB (μV/m) for mobile stations using amplitude modulation if the sound broadcasting station uses vertical or mixed polarization; - 16 dB (μV/m) for mobile stations using frequency modulation if the sound broadcasting station uses vertical or mixed polarization. In the case of mixed polarization, only the vertical component of the total effective radiated power of the sound broadcasting station should be taken into account if at least one-tenth of the total effective radiated power is radiated in the vertical component. These limits apply when the frequency of the sound broadcasting station coincides with the frequency of the station of the land mobile service. If they do not coincide, an appropriate allowance should be made (see Annex 5, Chapter 2). The interfering field strengths are calculated using the method contained in Annex 4, Chapter 4 at 10 metres above ground at the edge of the service area. 4.3.7.6 a station in the mobile, except aeronautical mobile (OR), service in Region 1 in the frequency band 104-108 MHz, it should normally accept the following interfering field strengths: - 18 dB (μV/m) if the sound broadcasting station uses horizontal polarization; - 0 dB (μV/m) if the sound broadcasting station uses vertical or mixed polarization. In the case of mixed polarization, only the vertical component of the total effective radiated power of the sound broadcasting station should be taken into account if at least one-tenth of the total effective radiated power is radiated in the vertical component. These limits apply when the frequency of the sound broadcasting station coincides with the frequency of the station of the mobile service. If they do not coincide, an appropriate allowance should be made (see Annex 5, Chapter 2). The interfering field strengths are calculated using the method contained in Annex 4, Chapter 4 at 10 m above ground at the site of the base station assuming the use of vertical polarization. 4.3.8 An administration receiving a telex from the IFRB sent in accordance with sections 4.2.7 or 4.3.3 may request the IFRB to calculate as indicated in section 4.3.7 above the increase in the usable field strength resulting from the proposed modification. 4.3.9 An administration may ask the administration proposing the modification to the Plan for any additional information it considers necessary to calculate the increase in the usable field strength. Similarly, the administration proposing the modification may ask any administration whose agreement it seeks for any additional information it considers necessary. The administrations shall inform the IFRB of such requests. 4.3.10 An administration which is not in a position to give its agreement to the proposed modification shall give its reasons within 100 days from the date of the weekly circular referred to the section 4.2.7 c. 4.3.11 Seventy days after the publication of the weekly circular mentioned in section 4.2.7 or 4.3.3, the IFRB shall request by telex any administration which has not yet given its decision in the matter to do so and shall inform it that, if no reply is received within an overall period of 100 days following the date of publication of this weekly circular, it is deemed to have agreed to the proposed modification to the Plan. This time limit may be extended by 14 days in the case of an administration which has requested additional information or which has asked the IFRB to carry out technical studies. 4.3.12 If at the end of the 100-day period (possibly extended by 14 days) there is continuing disagreement, the IFRB shall make any study that may be requested by these administrations; it shall inform them of the result of the study and shall make such recommendations as it may be able to offer for the solution of the problem. 4.3.13 An administration may request the assistance of the IFRB in the following cases: - in seeking the agreement of another administration; - in applying any stage of the procedure described in this Article; - in carrying out technical studies in relation to this procedure; - in applying the procedure with respect to other administrations. 4.4 *Comments of other administrations* 4.4.1 On receipt of the special section of the IFRB weekly circular published pursuant to section 4.2.7, administrations may send their comments to the administration proposing the modification either directly or through the IFRB. In any event the IFRB shall be informed that comments have been made. 4.4.2 An administration which has not notified its comments either to the administration concerned or to the IFRB within a period of 100 days following the date of the weekly circular referred to in section 4.2.7 c. shall be understood to have no objection to the proposed change. This time limit may be extended by 14 days in the case of an administration which has requested additional information or which has asked the IFRB to carry out technical studies. 4.5 *Cancellation of an Assignment* When the assignment in conformity with this Agreement is cancelled, whether or not as a result of a modification (for instance, in connection with a change of frequency), the administration concerned shall immediately inform the IFRB, which shall publish this information in a special section of its weekly circular. 4.6 *Updating of the Plan* 4.6.1 An administration which has obtained the agreement of the administrations whose names were published in the special section referred to in sections 4.2.7 and 4.3.3, may bring the assignment in question into use and shall inform the IFRB, indicating the final agreed characteristics of the assignment together with the names of the administrations with which agreement has been reached. 4.6.2 The IFRB shall publish in the special section of its weekly circular the information received under sections 4.2.5 or 4.6.1 together with the names of any administrations with which the provisions of the article have been successfully applied. With respect to Contracting Members, the assignment concerned shall enjoy the same status as those appearing in the Plan. 4.6.3 The IFRB shall maintain an up-to-date master copy of the Plan, taking account of any modifications, additions and deletions made in accordance with the procedure of this Article. 4.6.4 The Secretary-General shall publish an up-to-date version of the Plan in an appropriate form as and when the circumstances justify and in any case every three years. 4.7 *Elimination of harmful interference* If a change, although made in accordance with the provisions of this Article, causes harmful interference to services of other Contracting Members, the administration which has made the change shall take the requisite action to eliminate such interference. 4.8 *Settlement of disputes* If, after application of the procedure described in this Article, the administrations concerned have been unable to reach agreement, they may resort to the procedure described in Article 50 of the Convention. They may also agree to apply the Optional Additional Protocol to the Convention. 
###Article 5

### *Compatibility with the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service* 

5.1 *General* 5.1.1 The Plan adopted by the Conference has identified the cases of potential interference to the aeronautical radionavigation stations, at a limited number of test points selected by administrations (see Annex 2, Chapter 7). Unresolved cases of Al, A2 and B2 type interference shall be dealt with by application of the procedures in section 5.2.1 below, and those of B1 type interference by application of the procedures in section 5.2.2 below, in both cases on the basis of the criteria contained in Annex 2, Chapter 7 (see also Annex 5). 5.1.2 Assignments in the Plan which may cause interference of any of these types to stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service are identified by the following symbols : <sup> 1)  *Note:* For an explanation of the symbols, see the text concerning the remarks in the Plan (Annex 1).  </sup> Al/... type Al interference A2/... type A2 interference B2/... type B2 interference followed by the symbols of the countries whose aeronautical radionavigation stations may be affected, or: B1/.../... type B1 interference followed, after the first oblique stroke, by the symbol of the country whose aeronautical radionavigation stations may be affected and, after the second oblique stroke, by the symbols of the countries whose sound broadcasting stations contribute to the interference. 5.2 *Implementation of the Plan* 5.2.1 *Type A1, A2 and B2 interference* 5.2.1.1 Before bringing into use an assignment in the Plan which bears a symbol A1/..., A2/... or B2/..., the administration responsible for the sound broadcasting station shall inform the administration designated after that symbol, not later than 120 days before the date of bringing into use, indicating the dates and conditions under which the sound broadcasting station intends to arrange test experimental transmissions. 5.2.1.2 The administrations concerned shall agree on the dates, duration and conditions of the test period. 5.2.1.3 The administration of the territory on which the aeronautical radionavigation station is operated shall verify the interference situation resulting from the experimental transmission. If this administration finds that the level of interference exceeds the level indicated in Annex 2, Chapter 7, it shall inform the administration of the territory on which the sound broadcasting station is to be operated. If there is disagreement on the level of interference caused to the aeronautical radionavigation station, this level will be verified at other test points to be determined by the administration responsible for the aeronautical radionavigation station. If that level still exceeds the level indicated in Annex 2, Chapter 7, the administration of the territory on which the sound broadcasting station is to be operated shall be informed, with a copy to the IFRB. 5.2.1.4 The administration of the territory on which the sound broadcasting station is to be operated shall immediately adopt appropriate measures to reduce the interference to the aeronautical radionavigation station to or below the level indicated in Annex 2, Chapter 7. 5.2.1.5 If, despite the full application of the foregoing provisions, the administrations concerned fail to reach an agreement, and if experimental test transmissions show that the operation of the sound broadcasting station would actually cause harmful interference to an aeronautical radionavigation station, the broadcasting station shall not be brought into service. However, the status of this assignment, although not in use, shall be maintained with regard to all other assignments in the Plan. 5.2.1.6 When notifying the assignment of the sound broadcasting station in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement, the administration responsible for this designated station shall indicate the agreement of the administration designated after the symbols A1/..., A2/... or B2/... 5.2.2 *Type B1 interference* 5.2.2.1 If all sound broadcasting stations contributing to the incompatibility case belong to the country operating the aeronautical radionavigation station, this case shall be resolved on a national basis. The IFRB shall offer assistance to the country concerned if it cannot resolve the case itself. 5.2.2.2 If all sound broadcasting stations contributing as "primary interferer" to the incompatibility case belong to the country operating the aeronautical radionavigation station, this case shall be dealt with as in section 5.2.2.1 after section 5.2.2.4 has been applied in respect of the foreign broadcasting station contributing as "secondary interferer" to the incompatibility. <sup> 1)  See paragraph 5.2.2.9.  </sup> <sup> 1)  See paragraph 5.2.2.9.  </sup> 5.2.2.3 Before bringing into use an assignment in the Plan which bears the symbol B1/.../..., the administration responsible for the sound broadcasting station shall consult all the administrations whose stations are likely to suffer interference, indicating the date at which it intends to bring this assignment into use. 5.2.2.4 Each administration whose sound broadcasting stations contribute to the interference shall reduce, in the direction of the test point considered, the effective radiated power of its sound broadcasting stations contributing to the incompatibility, where this is possible without reducing their service areas. 5.2.2.5 If this is insufficient, the administrations concerned shall take such appropriate measures as they may agree upon in order to avoid B1 interference. 5.2.2.6 In case of disagreement, the following measures shall be envisaged: a. reduction of power of all sound broadcasting stations contributing to the incompatibility in the direction of the test point considered (by reducing the transmitter output power, by reducing the effective radiated power by means of an appropriate antenna diagram, or both); b. seeking an alternative frequency for one of the sound broadcasting stations; c. in exceptional cases seeking an alternative frequency for the aeronautical radionavigation station. a. to c. are not given in order of priority. The most appropriate measure will depend on the particular case. 5.2.2.7 If, despite the full application of the foregoing provisions, the administrations concerned fail to reach an agreement, the bringing into use of any sound broadcasting assignment contributing to the interference shall be subject to experimental test transmissions to be carried out as indicated in sections 5.2.1.1 to 5.2.1.3 above. If the experimental test transmissions show that the operation of the broadcasting assignment under test will give rise to a level of interference to the aeronautical radionavigation station concerned in excess of that indicated in Annex 2, Chapter 7, the administration responsible for the sound broadcasting assignment shall immediately adopt appropriate measures to reduce the interference to the aeronautical radionavigation station to or below the level indicated in Annex 2, Chapter 7. If this is not possible, there are two cases to be considered: a. if the assignment to be brought into use belongs to an administration which has more than one assignment contributing to the interference, this administration shall decide which of its assignments shall not operate. However, the status of this assignment, although not in use, shall be maintained with regard to all other assignments in the Plan; b. if the sound broadcasting stations contributing to the interference belong to different administrations, the sound broadcasting station whose assignment is to be brought into use shall not be brought into service. However, the status of this assignment, although not in use, shall be maintained with regard to all other assignments in the Plan. 5.2.2.8 When notifying the assignment of the sound broadcasting station in accordance with Article 7 of this Agreement, the administration responsible for this station shall indicate the agreement of the administrations whose stations were likely to suffer interference. 5.2.2.9 For the purpose of these provisions, a primary interferer is a sound broadcasting station the power of which at the input to the aeronautical radionavigation receiver located at the test point is equal to or above the trigger value, and a secondary interferer is a sound broadcasting station the power of which at the input the aeronautical radionavigation receiver located at the test point is equal to or above the cut-off value but below the trigger value (see Annex 2, Chapter 7). 5.3 *Modifications to the Plan* 5.3.1 Any administration wishing to modify the Plan shall obtain the agreement of any other administration whose aeronautical radionavigation stations are likely to be affected. 5.3.2 The aeronautical radionavigation stations of an administration are likely to be affected if the distance from the sound broadcasting station under consideration to the nearest point on the boundary of that country is less than the limit indicated in Annex 4, Chapter 3. 5.3.3 The administrations concerned shall agree on the criteria and methods to be used, taking into account those developed during the Conference (see Annex 2) and use the updated Plan and updated lists of the aeronautical radionavigation stations as well as any criteria appearing in the latest relevant CCIR Recommendations. 5.3.4 Administrations may request the IFRB to carry out this coordination on their behalf, including any calculations required for the protection of the aeronautical radionavigation stations, provided they supply the necessary information to the IFRB. 
###Article 6

### *Continued Coordination of Assignments Appearing in the Appendix to the Plan* 

6.1 The requirements concerning assignments which cause a nuisance field strength higher than 60 dB/μV/m to other assignments and which have not secured all the necessary agreements during the Conference are contained in the Appendix to the Plan. They will remain in this Appendix until 1 July 1992. Exceptionally, at the request of one or more of the administrations concerned, an assignment may remain in the Appendix until 31 December 1993; a copy of this request shall be sent to the IFRB. 6.2 Until the dates indicated in section 6.1 above, these assignments have the same status as the other assignments in the Plan as regards the application of the provisions of Article 4. 6.3 Administrations should continue coordination of these assignments, taking account of the geographical conditions and other relevant factors to the extent that the necessary data are available, and inform the IFRB of the agreements obtained. 6.4 When the IFRB finds that: - all the necessary agreements have been obtained, or - the assignment appearing in the Appendix to the Plan has been modified in such a way that its nuisance field strength caused to the stations of the administrations whose agreement is still required is 60dB/μV/m or less, it shall publish the assignment concerned in a special section of its weekly circular and shall transfer it to the appropriate part of the Plan. 6.5 For the purpose of applying Article 4, the reference usable field strength to be used shall be: - for an assignment appearing in Part 1 or Part 2 of the Plan, the usable field strength resulting from the other assignments appearing in those parts of the Plan; - for an assignment appearing in the Appendix, the usable field strength resulting from all the assignments appearing in the Plan including the Appendix. 6.6 Each time an assignment is transferred from the Appendix to the appropriate part of the Plan, the reference usable field strength of the stations concerned shall be calculated again and the result obtained shall be used for the application of the provisions of Article 4.

### ANNEX  4  

####Limits for determining when coordination with another administration is required as a result of a proposed modification to the Plan

###CHAPTER 1

### *Limits relating to sound broadcasting* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4 the following tables of distances between the broadcasting station and the nearest point on the boundary of any other administration shall be used to identify administrations whose sound broadcasting services may be considered as affected (Tables 4.1 tot 4.4). The coordination distances of Tables 4.1 to 4.4 apply to cases where the propagation path is over land (index L), over cold sea (SC), over warm sea (SW), or in an area of super-refractivity and ducting (SS), respectively. To simplify coordination, the distances that would be adequate for the various FM sound broadcasting systems were unified by starting a single value of 54 dB (µV/m) for the nuisance field and by taking mean values for the protection ratio (39 dB for tropospheric, 47 dB for steady interference). The larger of the two distance values resulting from tropospheric and steady interference was adopted and rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 km or 5 km for coordination distances above or below 100 km, respectively. Linear interpolation shall be used for effective radiated powers, in dBW, differing from those given in the tables and also for effective antenna heights, other than those in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. Antenna heights of 10 m or 1800 m, respectively, shall be used when the actual height is below the former or above the latter value. For mixed paths the coordination distance.D <sub>M</sub>, shall be the sum of the pertinent fractions of the coordination distances, D <sub>i</sub> applicable to every type of propagation path involved.   ![10000050369](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000050369)
where d <sub>T</sub> is the total path length from the transmitter to the nearest point on the border of the country concerned;and d <sub>i</sub> is the total length of those parts of the path which are over land, over cold sea, over warm sea or in areas of super-refractivity as the case may be.

###CHAPTER 2

### *Limits relating to television* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4, the following tables of distances between the sound broadcasting station and the nearest point on the boundary of any other administration shall be used to identify administrations whose TV broadcasting services operating in accordance with the Regional Agreement (Stockholm, 1961) may be considered as affected (Tables 4.5 to 4.8). The coordination distances in Tables 4.5 to 4.7 shall be used to ensure compatibility with television stations in countries using the band 87.5-100 MHz for television in accordance with the Regional Agreement (Stockholm, 1961). The tables apply to propagation paths which are fully overland or oversea (cold or warm). They are based on a nuisance field of 52 dB (μV/m) obtained by interpolation between values given for the bands 41-68 MHz and 174-223 MHz in the "Technical Data used by the European VHF/UHF Broadcasting Conference (Stockholm, 1961)" (part 4, section 4.2) and a protection ratio of 50 dB for tropospheric interference in accordance with Figure 2.9, in Chapter 5 of Annex 2. The coordination distances so obtained were rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 km or 5 km, respectively, for coordination distances above or below 100 km. Coordination distances for steady interference are included in Tables 4.5 to 4.7 when they exceed those for tropospheric interference. They were derived from Figures 2.1 and 2.2 of Annex 2, adopting protection ratio values 10dB above those for tropospheric interference. The corrections given in Table 4.8 take account of the fact that the protection ratio is a function of the frequency difference between the interfering signal and the wanted television signal. To account for this effect, the effective radiated power, in dBW, shall be reduced by this correction before the coordination distance is determined. A value of 0dB shall be used when the corrected effective radiated power, in dBW, is negative. Linear interpolation shall be used for effective radiated powers, in dBW, differing from those given in the tables and also for effective antenna heights (m) other than those in Tables 4.1 to 4.3. Antenna heights of 10 m or 1800 m, respectively, shall be used when the actual height is below the former or above the latter value. For mixed paths the coordination distance, *D <sub>M</sub>*, shall be the sum of the pertinent fractions of the coordination distances, *D <sub>i</sub>,* applicable to every type of propagation path involved.   ![10000050369](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000050369)
where d <sub>T</sub> is the total path length from the transmitter to the nearest point on the border of the country concerned;and d <sub>i</sub> is the total length of those parts of the path which are over land, over cold sea, over warm sea as the case may be.

###CHAPTER 3

### *Limits relating to aeronautical radionavigation services* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4, the aeronautical radionavigation services of another administration are considered as being affected if the distance from the sound broadcasting station to the nearest point on the boundary of that administration is less than 500 km. 
###CHAPTER 4

### *Limits relating to the land mobile service* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4, the land mobile service of administrations listed in Nos. 487 and 589 of the Radio Regulations and of Contracting Members of Region 3 (in the band 87.5-100 MHz) are considered as being affected if the field strength from the sound broadcasting station exceeds the following limits at the nearest point on the boundary of another administration: - for sound broadcasting stations using only horizontal polarization: 18dB(μV/m); - for sound broadcasting stations using vertical or mixed polarization: 0dB(μV/m); Within the band 87.5-88 MHz and for the land mobile service of countries mentioned in No. 581 of the Radio Regulations the following alternative limits shall apply: - for sound broadcasting stations using only horizontal polarization: 14dB(μV/m); - for sound broadcasting stations using only vertical or mixed polarization: 6dB (μV/m). The field strength will be calculated for a receiving antenna height of 10 m above ground, based on the curves in Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 (50% of locations, 10% of time). For mixed paths the calculation method as described in section 2.1.3.5 of Annex 2 will be applied. In the case of mixed polarization, only the vertical component of the total e.r.p. of the sound broadcasting station should be taken into account. It is assumed that the land mobile service is vertically polarized and that in the case of mixed polarization of the sound broadcasting station at least onetenth of the total e.r.p. of the sound broadcasting station is radiated in the vertical component. 
###CHAPTER 5

### *Limits relating to the fixed service* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4, the fixed service of the administrations listed in No. 588 of the Radio Regulations and of the Contracting Members of Region 3 in the band 87.5-100 MHz shall be considered as affected if the field strength from the sound broadcasting station at the nearest point on the boundary of another administration exceeds the following limit. For sound broadcasting stations: 0B (μV/m). The field strength will be calculated for a receiving antenna height of 10 m above ground, using the curves in Figures 4.1,4.2 and 4.3 (50% of locations, 10% of time). For mixed paths, the calculation method described in section 2.1.3.5 of Annex 2 will be applied.   ![10000050369](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000050369)

###CHAPTER 6

### *Limits relating to the aeronautical mobile (OR) service* 

In applying section 4.2.2 of Article 4, the aeronautical mobile (OR) service of the administrations listed in Nos. 587 and 589 of the Radio Regulations is considered as being affected if the field strength from the sound broadcasting station at the boundary of one of these administrations exceeds 20 dB (uV/m) at an altitude of 10000 metres. This field strength is based on free space propagation. The coordination distance shall be not more than the line-of-sight distance corresponding to an effective Earth radius equal to 4/3 of the actual radius.   

### ANNEX  5  

####Additional technical data which may be used for coordination between administrations

###CHAPTER 1

### *Aeronautical radionavigation service* 

1.1 *Separation distance for compatibility* Table 5.1 gives the minimum separation distances between a test point of the radionavigation station to be protected and a sound broadcasting station at which the protection criteria for Al, A2, B1 and B2 types of interference are all met. The more critical requirements are those for Al and Bl; the higher of the two separation distances is shown in each case. The Al distances assume the protection ratio for frequency coincidence, and that the level of the broadcasting transmitter spurious emissions conform to the level given in section 7.6.3.2 of Annex 2. The B1 distances ensure that the signal level is below the cut-off value as given in section 7.6.5.4 of Annex 2 with free-space propagation, but are subject to an upper limit of 500 km due to the practical considerations of the line-of-sight limit, in conformity with section 7.3 of Annex 2. Where two or more assignments are used at a common site, the highest e.r.p. must be taken. Linear interpolation shall be used for e.r.p. (in dBW) and frequency values not appearing in the table. Preliminary analyses based on these distances assume, in the case of A1 and B1 types of interference, that there is frequency coincidence between a spurious emission or intermodulation product and the frequency of the radionavigation station. When the frequencies of the radionavigation station and of all broadcasting transmitters that may be involved are known, detailed calculations can be made for all types of interference using the data for protection of the aeronautical radionavigation service given in Chapter 7 of Annex 2. However, in the case of A1 type interference it will be necessary to check that the transmitter does not generate significant spurious components apart from third-order intermodulation products. Any case-by-case study may take into account other relevant factors such as details of the propagation path between the broadcasting station and the aeronautical test point, and the radiation pattern of the broadcasting antenna in both the vertical and horizontal planes. 1.2 *Future improvements in aeronautical receivers* It is expected that future receivers will permit a significant relaxation of compatibility criteria and that the following revised criteria will be applied from 1 January 1998. 1.2.1 *B1 type interference* Present indications from the ICAO are that the two-signal case criterion for B1 type interference given in section 7.6.5.1 of Annex 2 will be replaced by:   ![10000050363](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000050363)
for both ILS and VOR receivers.

Subject to further study of type B1 interference by the CCIR, it is expected that a comparable relaxation in the criterion for the three-signal case will be possible and that the trigger and cut-off values given in section 7.6.5.2 of Annex 2 will be raised by 16 dB. 1.2.2 *B2 type interference* The maximum permitted broadcasting signal levels at the input to the ILS or VOR receiver for B2 type interference shall be those given in the Table 5.2 in place of the values given in Table 2.11 of Annex 2.

For frequencies in between the values given above, the maximum permitted level will be determined by linear interpolation. 1.2.3 *Further studies* Studies on possible improvements are requested in Recommendation No. 4.

Propagation data to be used for sharing calculations: Propagation curves for calculating interference to the land mobile service operating in the VHF bands shall be derived from the broadcasting propagation curves (Figures 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of Annex 4). Since these propagation curves are for a receiving antenna height of 10 m above the local terrain and the receiving antenna height is reduced from 10 m to 3 m, a 9dB reduction in the field strength shall be applied. *Note* - The method and criteria concerning antenna height gain factors to be used by administrations for coordination between the broadcasting and land mobile and fixed services are to be agreed by the administrations concerned and should be based where possible on the latest relevant CCIR Recommendations.

The field strength to be protected the height gain factors other than those specified and the effect of the directivity of the antenna in the fixed service will be considered by the administration concerned. 
###CHAPTER 3

When the frequencies of the broadcasting and the aeronautical mobile stations are both known, the field strengths given in Table 5.4 below may be used as sharing criteria.

###CHAPTER 4

### *Supplementary propagation data correction factors* 

This chapter gives supplementary correction factors which can be applied to the basic propagation curves to improve the accuracy of predictions in particular cases of coordination involving bilateral or multilateral negotiations between administrations. 4.1 *Correction for various location percentages* The propagation curves in Annexes 2 and 5 are representative of 50% of locations. Figure 5.1 shows the correction (in dB) to be applied for other percentages of receiving locations. 4.2 *Receiver terrain correction (terrain clearance angle)* The location correction in section 4.1 above can be applied only on a statistical basis. If more precision is required for predicting the field strength in a specific small receiving area a correction may be based on a "terrain clearance angle". This angle Θ is measured at a point chosen to be representative of the reception area; it is defined as the angle between the horizontal plane passing through the receiving antenna and the line from this antenna which clears all obstacles within 16 km in the direction of the transmitter. The example in Figure 5.2 indicates the sign convention, which is negative if the line to the obstacles is above the horizontal. Figure 5.3 indicates the correction, as a function of the angle 9, to be applied to the prediction for 50% of locations. If this correction is applied, the location correction in section 4.1 (Figure 5.1) may no longer be applicable. Corrections for terrain clearance angles outside the range - 5° to 0.5°, are not given in Figure 5.3, because of the lack of experimental data. However, they may be obtained tentatively by linear extrapolation of the curve in Figure 5.3 with limiting values of 30 dB at 1.5° and -15°, subject to the condition that the free-space field strength is not exceeded.   ![10000050363](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000050363)
