A.Until the putting into operation of the Common Agricultural Policy for ordinary wheat (application of the levy or levies), the Member States undertake not to modify their national import systems in such a way as to make them more restrictive.

B.Upon adoption of the agricultural policy for ordinary wheat, the Community undertakes to enter into negotiations with Canada on the situation of exports of these products by Canada. The negotiations provided for under this paragraph will take place on the basis of the negotiating rights which Canada held under the General Agreement for these products as of September 1, 1960.

C. The parties signatory to this agreement in no way limit their rights under GATT or on any other basis.
