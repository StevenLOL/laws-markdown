##Overeenkomst betreffende de vaststelling van mondiale technische reglementen voor wielvoertuigen, uitrustingsstukken en onderdelen die kunnen worden aangebracht en/of gebruikt op wielvoertuigen

####Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles

Preamble The Contracting Parties, Having decided to adopt an Agreement to establish a process for promoting the development of global technical regulations ensuring high levels of safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance of Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts which can be fitted and/or be used on Wheeled Vehicles; Having decided that such process shall also promote the harmonization of existing technical regulations, recognizing the right of subnational, national and regional authorities to adopt and maintain technical regulations in the areas of health, safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance that are more stringent than those established at the global level; Having authorization to enter into such an Agreement under paragraph 1a) of the Terms of Reference of the UN/ECE and Chapter XIII of the Rules of Procedure of the UN/ECE, Rule 50; Recognizing that this Agreement does not prejudice the rights and obligations of a Contracting Party under existing international agreements on health, safety and environmental protection; Recognizing that this Agreement does not prejudice the rights and obligations of a Contracting Party under the agreements under the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), and intending to establish global technical regulations under this agreement, as a basis for their technical regulations in a manner consistent with these agreements; Intending that Contracting Parties to this Agreement use the global technical regulations established under this Agreement as a basis for their technical regulations; Recognizing the importance to public health, safety and welfare of continuously improving and seeking high levels of safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles, and the potential value to international trade, consumer choice and product affordability of increasing convergences in existing and future technical regulations and their related standards; Recognizing that governments have the right to seek and implement improvements in the level of health, safety and environmental protection, and to determine whether the global technical regulations established under this Agreement are suitable for their needs; Recognizing the important harmonization work already carried out under the 1958 Agreement; Recognizing the interest and expertise in different geographic regions regarding safety, environmental, energy and anti-theft problems and methods of solving those problems, and the value of that interest and expertise in developing global technical regulations to aid in achieving those improvements and in minimizing divergences; Desiring to promote the adoption of established global technical regulations in developing countries, taking into account the special issues and circumstances for those countries, and in particular the least developed of them; Desiring that the technical regulations applied by the Contracting Parties be given due consideration through transparent procedures in developing global technical regulations, and that such consideration include comparative analyses of benefits and cost effectiveness; Recognizing that establishing global technical regulations providing high levels of protection will encourage individual countries to conclude that those Regulations will provide the protection and performance needed within their jurisdiction; Recognizing the impact of the quality of vehicle fuels on the performance of vehicle environmental controls, human health, and fuel efficiency; and Recognizing that the use of transparent procedures is of particular importance in developing global technical regulations under this Agreement and that this development process must be compatible with the regulatory development processes of the Contracting Parties to this Agreement; Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1  

####Purpose

1.1.  The purpose of this Agreement is: 

1.1.1. To establish a global process by which Contracting Parties from all regions of the world can jointly develop global technical regulations regarding the safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and anti-theft performance of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles;  

1.1.2. To ensure that, in developing global technical regulations, due and objective consideration is given to the existing technical regulations of Contracting Parties, and to the UN/ECE Regulations;  

1.1.3. To ensure that objective consideration is given to the analysis of best available technology, relative benefits and cost effectiveness as appropriate in developing global technical regulations;  

1.1.4. To ensure that the procedures used in developing global technical regulations are transparent;  

1.1.5. To achieve high levels of safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency, and anti-theft performance within the global community, and to ensure that actions under this Agreement do not promote, or result in, a lowering of these levels within the jurisdiction of Contracting Parties, including the subnational level;  

1.1.6. To reduce technical barriers to international trade through harmonizing existing technical regulations of Contracting Parties, and UN/ECE Regulations, and developing new global technical regulations governing safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and anti-theft performance of wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles, consistent with the achievement of high levels of safety and environment protection and the other above-stated purposes; and  

1.1.7. To ensure that, where alternative levels of stringency are needed to facilitate the regulatory activities of certain countries, in particular developing countries, such needs are taken into consideration in developing and establishing global technical regulations.     
1.2.  This Agreement is to operate in parallel with the 1958 Agreement, without affecting the institutional autonomy of either Agreement.
