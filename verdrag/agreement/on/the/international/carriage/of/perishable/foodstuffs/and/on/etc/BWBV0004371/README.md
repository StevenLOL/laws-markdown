####Agreement on the international carriage of perishable foodstuffs and on the special equipment to be used for such carriage (ATP)

The Contracting Parties, Desirous of improving the conditions of preservation of the quality of perishable foodstuffs during their carriage, particularly in international trade, Considering that the improvement of those conditions is likely to promote the expansion of trade in perishable foodstuffs,  Have agreed as follows:  
###Chapter I 

####Special transport equipment

### Article  1  

For the international carriage of perishable foodstuffs, equipment shall not be designated as “insulated”, “refrigerated”, “mechanically refrigerated”, or “heated” equipment unless it complies with the definitions and standards set forth in annex 1 to this Agreement. 

### Article  2  

The Contracting Parties shall take the measures necessary to ensure that the equipment referred to in article 1 of this Agreement is inspected and tested for compliance with the said standards in conformity with the provisions of annex 1, appendices 1, 2, 3 and 4, to this Agreement. Each Contracting Party shall recognize the validity of certificates of compliance issued in conformity with annex 1, appendix 1, paragraph 3 to this Agreement by the competent authority of another Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party may recognize the validity of certificates of compliance issued in conformity with the requirements of annex 1, appendices 1 and 2, to this Agreement by the competent authority of a country not a Contracting Party. 

###Chapter II 

####Use of special transport equipment for the international carriage of certain perishable foodstuffs

### Article  3  

1.  The provisions of article 4 of this Agreement shall apply to all carriage, whether for hire or reward or for own account, carried out exclusively - subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article - by rail, by road or by a combination of the two, of 

- quick (deep)-frozen and frozen foodstuffs, and of  

- foodstuffs referred to in annex 3 to this Agreement even if they are neither quick (deep)-frozen nor frozen,   if the point at which the goods are, or the equipment containing them is, loaded on to a rail or road vehicle and the point at which the goods are, or the equipment containing them is, unloaded from that vehicle are in two different States and the point at which the goods are unloaded is situated in the territory of a Contracting Party. In the case of carriage entailing one or more sea crossings other than sea crossings as referred to in paragraph 2 of this article, each land journey shall be considered separately.  
2.  The provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall likewise apply to sea crossings of less than 150 km on condition that the goods are shipped in equipment used for the land journey or journeys without transloading of the goods and that such crossings precede or follow one or more land journeys as referred to in paragraph 1 of this article or take place between two such land journeys.   
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article, the Contracting Parties need not apply the provisions of article 4 of this Agreement to the carriage of foodstuffs not intended for human consumption.  

### Article  4  

1.  For the carriage of the perishable foodstuffs specified in annexes 2 and 3 to this Agreement, the equipment referred to in article 1 of this Agreement shall be used unless the temperatures to be anticipated throughout carriage render this requirement manifestly unnecessary for the purpose of maintaining the temperature conditions specified in annexes 2 and 3 to this Agreement. The equipment shall be so selected and used that the temperature conditions prescribed in the said annexes can be complied with throughout carriage. Furthermore, all appropriate measures shall be taken, more particularly as regards the temperature of the foodstuffs at the time of loading and as regards icing or re-icing during the journey or other necessary operations. Nevertheless, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply only in so far as they are not incompatible with international undertakings in the matter of international carriage arising for the Contracting Parties by virtue of conventions in force at the time of the entry into force of this Agreement or by virtue of conventions substituted for them.   
2.  If during carriage under this Agreement the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article have not been complied with, 

(a) the foodstuffs may not be disposed of in the territory of a Contracting Party after completion of carriage unless the competent authorities of that Contracting Party deem it compatible with the requirements of public health to authorize such disposal and unless such conditions as the authorities may attach to the authorization when granting it are fulfilled; and  

(b) every Contracting Party may, by reason of the requirements of public health or zooprophylaxis and in so far as it is not incompatible with the other international undertakings referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 1 of this article, prohibit the entry of the foodstuffs into its territory or make their entry subject to such conditions as it may determine.     
3.  Compliance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article shall be required of carriers for hire or reward only in so far as they have undertaken to procure or provide services intended to ensure such compliance and if such compliance depends on the performance of those services. If other persons, whether individuals or corporate bodies, have undertaken to procure or provide services intended to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, they shall be required to ensure such compliance in so far as it depends on performance of the service they have undertaken to procure or provide.   
4.  During carriage which is subject to the provisions of this Agreement and for which the loading point is situated in the territory of a Contracting Party, responsibility for compliance with the requirements of paragraph 1 of this article shall rest, subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this article, 

- in the case of transport for hire or reward, with the person, whether an individual or a corporate body, who is the consignor according to the transport document or, in the absence of a transport document, with the person, whether an individual or a corporate body, who has entered into the contract of carriage with the carrier;  

- in other cases with the person, whether an individual or a corporate body, who performs carriage.    

###Chapter III 

####Miscellaneous provisions

### Article  5  

The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to carriage in containers classified as thermal maritime by land without transloading of the goods where such carriage is preceded or followed by a sea crossing other than a sea crossing as referred to in article 3, paragraph 2, of this Agreement. 

### Article  6  

1.  Each Contracting Party shall take all appropriate measures to ensure observance of the provisions of this Agreement. The competent administrations of the Contracting Parties shall keep one another informed of the general measures taken for this purpose.   
2.  If a Contracting Party discovers a breach committed by a person residing in the territory of another Contracting Party, or imposes a penalty upon such a person, the administration of the first Party shall inform the administration of the other Party of the breach discovered and of the penalty imposed.  

### Article  7  

The Contracting Parties reserve the right to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements to the effect that provisions applicable to special equipment and provisions applicable to the temperatures at which certain foodstuffs are required to be maintained during carriage may, more particularly by reason of special climatic conditions, be more stringent than those prescribed in this Agreement. Such provisions shall apply only to international carriage between Contracting States which have concluded bilateral or multilateral agreements as referred to in this article. Such agreements shall be transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations who shall communicate them to Contracting Parties to this Agreement which are not signatories of the said agreements. 

### Article  8  

Failure to observe the provisions of this Agreement shall not affect either the existence of the validity of contracts entered into for the performance of carriage.

1. Checks for conformity with the standards prescribed in this annex shall be made: 

a) before equipment enters into service;  

b) periodically, at least once every six years;  

c) whenever required by the competent authority.   Except in the cases provided for in appendix 2, sections 5 and 6, to this annex, the checks shall be made at a testing station designated or approved by the competent authority of the country in which the equipment is registered or recorded, unless, in the case of the check referred to in (a) above, a check has already been made on the equipment itself or on its prototype in a testing station designated or approved by the competent authority of the country in which the equipment was manufactured.  

2. The methods and procedures to be used in checking for compliance with the standards are described in appendix 2 to this annex.  

3. A certificate of compliance with the standards shall be issued by the competent authority of the country in which the equipment is to be registered or recorded. This certificate shall conform to the model reproduced in appendix 3 to this annex.The certificate of compliance shall be carried on the equipment during carriage and be produced whenever so required by the control authorities. However, if a certification plate of compliance, as reproduced in appendix 3 to this annex, is fixed to the equipment, the certification plate of compliance shall be recognized as equivalent to a certificate of compliance. A certification plate of compliance may be fixed to the equipment only when a valid certificate of compliance is available. Certification plates of compliance shall be removed as soon as the equipment ceases to conform to the standards laid down in this annex.In the case of equipment transferred to another country, which is a Contracting Party to ATP, it shall be accompanied by the following documents so that the competent authority of the country in which the equipment is to be registered or recorded can issue a certificate of compliance:

a) in all cases, the test report of the equipment itself or, in the case of serially produced equipment, of the reference equipment;  

b) in all cases, the certificate of compliance issued by the competent authority of the country of manufacture or, for equipment in service, the competent authority of the country of registration. This certificate will be treated as a provisional certificate valid, if necessary, for three months;  

c) in the case of serially produced equipment, the technical specification of the equipment to be certified as issued by the manufacturer of the equipment or his duly accredited representative (this specification shall cover the same items as the descriptive pages concerning the equipment which appear in the test report and shall be drawn up in at least one of the official languages). In the case of equipment transferred after it has been in use, the equipment may be subject to a visual inspection to confirm its identity before the competent authority of the country, in which it is to be registered or recorded, issues a certificate of compliance. 

4. Distinguishing marks and particulars shall be affixed to the equipment in conformity with the provisions of appendix 4 to this annex. They shall be removed as soon as the equipment ceases to conform to the standards laid down in this annex.  

5.

###Annex  1  

####, Appendix 2 

Methods and procedures for measuring and checking the insulating capacity and the efficiency of the cooling or heating appliances of special equipment for the carriage of perishable foodstuffs 

### 1  

####Definitions and general principles

1.1.   *K coefficient*. The overall heat transfer coefficient (K coefficient) of the special equipment is defined by the following formula: ![10000054284](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054284)
where W is either the heating power or the cooling capacity, as the case may be, required to maintain a constant absolute temperature difference ∆T between the mean inside temperature T<sub>i</sub> and the mean outside temperature T<sub>e</sub>, during continuous operation, when the mean outside temperature T<sub>e</sub> is constant for a body of mean surface area S.   
1.2.   *The mean surface area S of the body* is the geometric mean of the inside surface area S<sub>i</sub> and the outside surface area S<sub>e</sub> of the body: ![10000054285](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054285)
In determining the two surface areas S<sub>i</sub> and S<sub>e</sub>, structural peculiarities and surface irregularities of the body, such as chamfers, wheel-arches and similar features, shall be taken into account and shall be noted under the appropriate heading in test reports; however, if the body is covered with corrugated sheet metal the area considered shall be that of the plane surface occupied, not that of the developed corrugated surface.  
###Temperature measuring points

1.3.  In the case of parallelepipedic bodies, *the mean inside temperature of the body* (T<sub>i</sub>) is the arithmetic mean of the temperatures measured 10 cm from the walls at the following 12 points: 

a) The eight inside corners of the body; and  

b) The centres of the four inside faces having the largest area.   If the body is not parallelepipedic, the 12 points of measurements shall be distributed as satisfactorily as possible having regard to the shape of the body.

####Procedure for measuring the effective refrigerating capacity w<sub>o</sub> of a unit when the evaporator is free from frost

4.1.  General principles   
4.1.1.  When attached to either a calorimeter box or the insulated body of a unit of transport equipment, and operating continuously, this capacity is:  *W<sub>o</sub>=W<sub>j</sub> + U. ∆T*  where *U* is the heat leakage of the calorimeter box or insulated body, Watts/°C.  *∆T* is the difference between the mean inside temperature *T<sub>i</sub> *and the mean outside temperature *T<sub>e</sub> *of the calorimeter or insulated body (K),  *W<sub>j</sub> *is the heat dissipated by the fan heater unit to maintain each temperature difference in equilibrium.   
4.2.  Test method   
4.2.1.  The refrigeration unit is either fitted to a calorimeter box, or the insulated body of a unit of transport equipment. In each case, the heat leakage is measured at a single mean wall temperature prior to the capacity test. An arithmetical correction factor, based upon the experience of the testing station, is made to take into account the average temperature of the walls at each thermal equilibrium during the determination of the effective refrigerating capacity. It is preferable to use a calibrated calorimeter box to obtain maximum accuracy. Measurements and procedure shall be as described in paragraphs 1.1 to 2.1.8 above; however, it is sufficient to measure U the heat leakage only, the value of this coefficient being defined by the following relationship: ![10000054287](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000054287)
where: W is the heating power (in watts) dissipated by the internal heater and fans;  *∆T<sub>m</sub> *is the difference between the mean internal temperature *T* <sub>i</sub> and the mean external temperature *T<sub>e</sub> *; U is the heat flow per degree of difference between the air temperature inside and outside the calorimeter box or unit of transport equipment measured with the refrigeration unit fitted. The calorimeter box or unit of transport equipment is placed in a test chamber. If a calorimeter box is used, U.∆T should be not more than 35% of the total heat flow W<sub>o</sub>. The calorimeter box or unit of transport equipment shall be heavily insulated.   
4.2.2.   *Instrumentation*  Test stations shall be equipped with instruments to measure the U value to an accuracy of ± 5%. Heat transfer through air leakage should not exceed 5% of the total heat transfer through the calorimeter box or through the insulated body of the unit of transport equipment. The refrigerating capacity shall be determined with an accuracy of ± 5%. The instrumentation of the calorimeter box or unit of transport equipment shall conform to paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 above. The following are to be measured: 

a) *Air temperatures:* At least four thermometers uniformly distributed at the inlet to the evaporator; At least four thermometers uniformly distributed at the outlet to the evaporator; At least four thermometers uniformly distributed at the air inlet(s) to the refrigeration unit; The thermometers shall be protected against radiation. The accuracy of the temperature measuring system shall be ± 0.2 K;  

b) *Energy consumption:* Instruments shall be provided to measure the electrical energy or fuel consumption of the refrigeration unit. The electrical energy and fuel consumption shall be determined with an accuracy of ±0.5%;  

c) *Speed of rotation:* Instruments shall be provided to measure the speed of rotation of the compressors and circulating fans or to allow these speeds to be calculated where direct measurement is impractical. The speed of rotation shall be measured to an accuracy of ±1%;  

d) *Pressure:* High precision pressure gauges (accurate to ± 1%) shall be fitted to the condenser and evaporator and to the compressor inlet when the evaporator is fitted with a pressure regulator.     
4.2.3.   *Test conditions* 

(i) The average air temperature at the inlet(s) to the refrigeration unit shall be maintained at 30 °C *+* 0.5 K. The maximum difference between the temperatures at the warmest and at the coldest points shall not exceed 2 K.  

(ii) Inside the calorimeter box or the insulated body of the unit of transport equipment (at the air inlet to the evaporator): there shall be three levels of temperature between – 25 °C and +12 °C depending on the characteristics of the unit, one temperature level being at the minimum prescribed for the class requested by the manufacturer with a tolerance of ± 1 K. The mean inside temperature shall be maintained within a tolerance of ± 0.5 K. During the measurement of refrigerating capacity, the heat dissipated within the calorimeter box or the insulated body of the unit of transport equipment shall be maintained at a constant level with a tolerance of ± 1%. When presenting a refrigeration unit for test, the manufacturer shall supply: 

– Documents describing the unit to be tested;  

– A technical document outlining the parameters that are most important to the functioning of the unit and specifying their allowable range;  

– The characteristics of the equipment series tested; and  

– A statement as to which prime mover(s) shall be used during testing.       
4.3.  Test procedure   
4.3.1.  The test shall be divided into two major parts, the cooling phase and the measurement of the effective refrigerating capacity at three increasing temperature levels. 

a) Cooling phase; the initial temperature of the calorimeter box or transport equipment shall be 30 ºC ± 3 K. It shall then be lowered to the following temperatures: – 25 ºC for – 20 ºC class, – 13 ºC for – 10 ºC class or – 2 ºC for 0 ºC class;  

b) Measurement of effective refrigerating capacity, at each internal temperature level. A first test to be carried out, for at least four hours at each level of temperature, under control of the thermostat (of the refrigeration unit) to stabilize the heat transfer between the interior and exterior of the calorimeter box or unit of transport equipment. A second test shall be carried out without the thermostat in operation in order to determine the maximum refrigerating capacity, with the heating power of the internal heater producing an equilibrium condition at each temperature level as prescribed in paragraph 4.2.3. The duration of the second test shall be not less than four hours. Before changing from one temperature level to another, the box or unit shall be manually defrosted. If the refrigeration unit can be operated by more than one form of energy, the tests shall be repeated accordingly. If the compressor is driven by the vehicle engine, the test shall be carried out at both the minimum speed and at the nominal speed of rotation of the compressor as specified by the manufacturer. If the compressor is driven by the vehicle motion, the test shall be carried out at the nominal speed of rotation of the compressor as specified by the manufacturer.     
4.3.2.  The same procedure shall be followed for the enthalpy method described below, but in this case the heat power dissipated by the evaporator fans at each temperature level shall also be measured. This method may, alternatively, be used to test reference equipment. In this case, the effective refrigerating capacity is measured by multiplying the mass flow (m) of the refrigerant liquid by the difference in enthalpy between the refrigerant vapour leaving the unit (h<sub>o</sub>) and the liquid at the inlet to the unit (h<sub>i</sub>). To obtain the effective refrigerating capacity, the heat generated by the evaporator fans (W<sub>f</sub>) is deducted. It is difficult to measure W<sub>f</sub> if the evaporator fans are driven by an external motor, in this particular case the enthalpy method is not recommended. When the fans are driven by internal electric motors, the electrical power is measured by appropriate instruments with an accuracy of ± 3%, with refrigerant flow measurement being accurate to ± 3%. The heat balance is given by the formula: W<sub>o</sub> = (h<sub>o</sub> - h<sub>i</sub>) m - W<sub>f</sub>. Appropriate methods are described in standards ISO 917, BS 3122, DIN, NEN, etc. An electric heater is placed inside the equipment in order to obtain the thermal equilibrium.   
4.3.3.   *Precautions* As the tests for effective refrigerating capacity are carried out with the thermostat of the refrigeration unit disconnected, the following precautions shall be observed: If the equipment has a hot gas injection system, it shall be inoperative during the test; with automatic controls of the refrigeration unit which unload individual cylinders (to tune the capacity of the refrigeration unit to motor output) the test shall be carried out with the number of cylinders appropriate for the temperature.   
4.3.4.   *Checks* The following should be verified and the methods used indicated on the test report: 

(i) the defrosting system and the thermostat are functioning correctly;  

(ii) the rate of air circulation is that specified by the manufacturer. If the air circulation of a refrigeration unit’s evaporator fans is to be measured, methods capable of measuring the total delivery volume shall be used. Use of one of the relevant existing standards, i.e. BS 848, ISO 5801, AMCA 210-85, AMCA 210-07, DIN 24163, NFE 36101, NF X10.102, DIN 4796 is recommended;  

(iii) the refrigerant used for tests is that specified by the manufacturer.     
4.4.  Test result   
4.4.1.  The refrigeration capacity for ATP purposes is that relating to the mean temperature at the inlet(s) of the evaporator. The temperature measuring instruments shall be protected against radiation.

####Checking the insulating capacity of equipment in service

For the purpose of checking the insulating capacity of each piece of equipment in service as prescribed in appendix 1, paragraphs 1 (b) and 1 (c), to this annex, the competent authorities may: Apply the methods described in paragraphs 2.1.1 to 2.3.2 of this appendix; or Appoint experts to assess the fitness of the equipment for retention in one or other of the categories of insulated equipment. These experts shall take the following particulars into account and shall base their conclusions on information as indicated below. 

5.1 General examination of the equipment This examination shall take the form of an inspection of the equipment to determine the following: 

(i) the durable manufacturer’s plate affixed by the manufacturer;  

(ii) the general design of the insulating sheathing;  

(iii) the method of application of insulation;  

(iv) the nature and condition of the walls;  

(v) the condition of the insulated compartment;  

(vi) the thickness of the walls;   and to make all appropriate observations concerning the effective insulating capacity of the equipment. For this purpose the experts may cause parts of the equipment to be dismantled and require all documents they may need to consult (plans, test reports, specifications, invoices, etc.) to be placed at their disposal.  

5.2 Examination for air-tightness (not applicable to tank equipment) The inspection shall be made by an observer stationed inside the equipment, which shall be placed in a brightly-illuminated area. Any method yielding more accurate results may be used.  

5.3 Decisions 

(i) If the conclusions regarding the general condition of the body are favourable, the equipment may be kept in service as insulated equipment of its initial class for a further period of not more than three years. If the conclusions of the expert or experts are not acceptable, the equipment may be kept in service only following a satisfactory measurement of K coefficient according to the procedure described in paragraphs 2.1.1 to 2.3.2 of this appendix; it may then be kept in service for a further period of six years.  

(ii) In the case of heavily insulated equipment, if the conclusions of an expert or experts show the body to be unsuitable for keeping in service in its initial class but suitable for continuing in service as normally insulated equipment, then the body may be kept in service in an appropriate class for a further three years. In this case, the distinguishing marks (as in appendix 4 of this annex) shall be changed appropriately.  

(iii) If the equipment consists of units of serially-produced equipment of a particular type satisfying the requirements of appendix l, paragraph 6, to this annex and belonging to one owner, then in addition to an inspection of each unit of equipment the K coefficient of not less than l% of the number of units involved, may be measured in conformity with the provisions of sections 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of this appendix. If the results of the examinations and measurements are acceptable, all the equipment in question may be kept in service as insulating equipment of its initial class for a further period of six years.

8.1. *Definitions*

a)Multi-compartment equipment: Equipment with two or more insulated compartments for maintaining a different temperature in each compartment;

b)Multi-temperature mechanical refrigeration unit: Mechanical refrigeration unit with compressor and common suction inlet, condenser and two or more evaporators set at different temperatures in the various compartments of multi-compartment equipment;

c)Host unit: Refrigeration unit with or without an integral evaporator;

d)Unconditioned compartment: a compartment considered to have no evaporator or for which the evaporator is inactive for the purposes of dimensioning calculations and certification;

e)Multi-temperature operation: Operation of a multi-temperature mechanical refrigeration unit with two or more evaporators operating at different temperatures in multi-compartment equipment;

f)Nominal refrigerating capacity: Maximum refrigerating capacity of the refrigeration unit in mono-temperature operation with two or three evaporators operating simultaneously at the same temperature;

g)Individual refrigerating capacity (P<sub>ind-evap</sub>): The maximum refrigerating capacity of each evaporator in solo operation with the host unit;

h)Effective refrigerating capacity (P<sub>eff-frozen-evap</sub>): The refrigerating capacity available to the lowest temperature evaporator when two or more evaporators are each operating in multi-temperature mode, as prescribed in paragraph 8.3.5.
8.2. *Test procedure for multi-temperature mechanical refrigeration units*

8.2.1 *General procedure*  The test procedure shall be as defined in section 4 of this appendix. The host unit shall be tested in combination with different evaporators. Each evaporator shall be tested on a separate calorimeter, if applicable. The nominal refrigerating capacity of the host unit in mono-temperature operation, as prescribed in paragraph 8.2.2, shall be measured with a single combination of two or three evaporators including the smallest and largest. The individual refrigerating capacity shall be measured for all evaporators, each in mono-temperature operation with the host unit, as prescribed in paragraph 8.2.3. This test shall be conducted with two or three evaporators including the smallest, the largest and, if necessary, a mid-sized evaporator. If the multi-temperature unit can be operated with more than two evaporators: 

– The host unit shall be tested with a combination of three evaporators: the smallest, the largest and a mid-sized evaporator.  

– In addition, on demand of the manufacturer, the host unit can be tested optionally with a combination of two evaporators: the largest and smallest.   The tests are done in independent mode and stand by. 

8.2.2 *Determination of the nominal refrigerating capacity of the host unit*  The nominal refrigerating capacity of the host unit in mono-temperature operation shall be measured with a single combination of two or three evaporators operating simultaneously at the same temperature. This test shall be conducted at –20°C and at 0°C. The air inlet temperature of the host unit shall be +30°C. The nominal refrigerating capacity at –10°C shall be calculated by linear interpolation from the capacities at –20°C and 0°C.

8.2.3 *Determination of the individual refrigerating capacity of each evaporator*  The individual refrigerating capacity of each evaporator shall be measured in solo operation with the host unit. The test shall be conducted at -20°C and 0°C. The air inlet temperature of the refrigeration unit shall be +30°C. The individual refrigerating capacity at –10°C shall be calculated by linear interpolation from the capacities at 0° C and –20°C.

8.2.4 *Test of the remaining effective refrigerating capacities of a set of evaporators in multi-temperature operation at a reference heat load*  The remaining effective refrigerating capacity shall be measured for each tested evaporator at –20°C with the other evaporator(s) operating under control of a thermostat set at 0 °C with a reference heat load of 20% of the individual refrigerating capacity at –20 °C of the evaporator in question. The air inlet temperature of the host unit shall be +30 °C. For multi-temperature refrigeration units with more than one compressor such as cascade systems or units with two-stage compression systems, where the refrigerating capacities can be simultaneously maintained in the frozen and chilled compartments, the measurement of the effective refrigerating capacity, shall be done at one additional heat load.
8.3. *Dimensioning and certification of refrigerated multi-temperature equipment*

8.3.1 *General procedure*  The refrigerating capacity demand of multi-temperature equipment shall be based on the refrigerating capacity demand of mono-temperature equipment as defined in this appendix. For multi-compartment equipment, a K coefficient less than or equal to 0.40 W/m².K for the outer body as a whole shall be approved in accordance with subsections 2 to 2.2 of this appendix. The insulation capacities of the outer body walls shall be calculated using the K coefficient of the body approved in accordance with this Agreement. The insulation capacities of the internal dividing walls shall be calculated using the K coefficients in the table in paragraph 8.3.7. For issuance of an ATP certificate: 

– The nominal refrigerating capacity of the multi-temperature refrigeration unit shall be at least equal to the heat loss through the internal dividing and outer body walls of the equipment as a whole multiplied by the factor 1.75 as specified in paragraph 3.2.6 of this appendix.  

– In each compartment, the calculated remaining effective refrigerating capacity at the lowest temperature of each evaporator in multi-temperature operation shall be greater than or equal to the maximum refrigeration demand of the compartment in the most unfavourable conditions, as prescribed in paragraphs 8.3.5 and 8.3.6, multiplied by the factor 1.75 as specified in paragraph 3.2.6 of this appendix.  

8.3.2 *Conformity of the entire body*  The outer body shall have a K value K ≤ 0.40 W/m<sup>2</sup>.K. The internal surface of the body shall not vary by more than 20%. The equipment shall conform to: P<sub>nominal</sub> > 1.75 * K<sub>body</sub> * S<sub>body</sub> * ΔT Where: 

– P<sub>nominal</sub> is the nominal refrigerating capacity of the multi-temperature refrigeration unit,  

– K<sub>body</sub> is the K value of the outer body,  

– S<sub>body</sub> is the internal surface of the full body,  

– ΔT is the difference in temperature between outside and inside the body.   

8.3.3 *Determination of the refrigerating demand of chilled evaporators*  With the bulkheads in given positions, the refrigerating capacity demand of each chilled evaporator is calculated as follows: P<sub>chilled demand</sub>= (S<sub>chilled-comp</sub>– ΣS<sub>bulk</sub>) * K<sub>body</sub>* ΔT<sub>ext</sub> + Σ (S<sub>bulk</sub>* K<sub>bulk</sub>* ΔT<sub>int</sub>) Where: 

– K<sub>body</sub> is the K value given by an ATP test report for the outer body,  

– S<sub>chilled-comp</sub> is the surface of the chilled compartment for the given positions of the bulkheads,  

– S<sub>bulk</sub> are the surfaces of the bulkheads,  

– K<sub>bulk</sub> are the K values of the bulkheads given by the table in paragraph 8.3.7,  

– ΔT<sub>ext</sub> is the difference in temperatures between the chilled compartment and +30°C outside the body,  

– ΔT<sub>int</sub> is the difference in temperatures between the chilled compartment and other compartments. For unconditioned compartments a temperature of +20°C shall be used for calculations.  

8.3.4 *Determination of the refrigerating demand of frozen compartments*  With the bulkheads in given positions, the refrigerating capacity demand of each frozen compartment is calculated as follows: P<sub>frozen demand</sub>= (S<sub>frozen-comp</sub>– ΣS<sub>bulk</sub>) * K<sub>body</sub>* ΔT<sub>ext</sub> + Σ (S<sub>bulk</sub>* K<sub>bulk</sub>* ΔT<sub>int</sub>) Where: 

– K<sub>body</sub> is the K value given by an ATP test report for the outer body,  

– S<sub>frozen-comp</sub> is the surface of the frozen compartment for the given positions of the bulkheads,  

– S<sub>bulk</sub> are the surfaces of the bulkheads,  

– K<sub>bulk</sub> are the K values of the bulkheads given by the table in paragraph 8.3.7,  

– ΔT<sub>ext</sub> is the difference in temperatures between the frozen compartment and +30 °C outside the body,  

– ΔT<sub>int</sub> is the difference in temperatures between the frozen compartment and other compartments. For insulated compartments a temperature of +20°C shall be used for calculations.  

8.3.5 *Determination of the effective refrigerating capacity of frozen evaporators*  The effective refrigerating capacity, in given positions of the bulkheads, is calculated as follows: P<sub>eff-frozen-evap</sub>= P<sub>ind-frozen-evap</sub> * [1 - Σ (P<sub>eff-chilled-evap</sub> / P<sub>ind-chilled-evap</sub>)] Where: 

– P<sub>eff-frozen-evap</sub> is the effective refrigerating capacity of the frozen evaporator with a given configuration,  

– P<sub>ind-frozen-evap</sub> is the individual refrigeration capacity of the frozen evaporator at –20 °C,  

– P<sub>eff-chilled-evap</sub> is the effective refrigeration capacity of each chilled evaporator in the given configuration as defined in paragraph 8.3.6,  

– P<sub>ind-chilled-evap</sub> is the individual refrigerating capacity at -20 °C for each chilled evaporator.   This calculation method is only approved for multi-temperature mechanical refrigeration units with a single one-stage compressor. For multi-temperature refrigeration units with more than one compressor such as cascade systems or units with two-stage compression systems, where the refrigerating capacities can be simultaneously maintained in the frozen and the chilled compartments, this calculation method shall not be used, because it will lead to an underestimation of the effective refrigerating capacities. For this equipment, the effective refrigerating capacities shall be interpolated between the effective refrigerating capacities measured with two different heat loads given in the tests reports as prescribed in 8.2.4.

8.3.6 *Conformity declaration*  The equipment is declared in conformity in multi-temperature operation if, for each position of the bulkheads, and each distribution of temperature in the compartments: P<sub>eff-frozen-evap</sub> ≥ 1.75 * P<sub>frozen demand</sub>  P<sub>eff-chilled-evap</sub> ≥ 1.75 * P<sub>chilled demand</sub>  Where: 

– P<sub>eff-frozen-evap</sub> is the effective refrigeration capacity of the considered frozen evaporator at the class temperature of the compartment in the given configuration,  

– P<sub>eff-chilled-evap</sub> is the effective refrigeration capacity of the considered chilled evaporator at the class temperature of the compartment in the given configuration,  

– P<sub>frozen demand</sub> is the refrigerating demand of the considered compartment at the class temperature of the compartment in the given configuration as calculated according to 8.3.4,  

– P<sub>chilled demand</sub> is the refrigerating demand of the considered compartment at the class temperature of the compartment in the given configuration as calculated according to 8.3.3.   It shall be considered that all the positions of the bulkheads have been dimensioned if the wall positions from the smallest to the largest compartment sizes are checked by iterative methods whereby no input step change in surface area is greater than 20%.

8.3.7 *Internal dividing walls*  Thermal losses through internal dividing walls shall be calculated using the K coefficients in the following table.  

|--- |  *K coefficient – [W/m<sup>2</sup>.K]*   |  *Minimum foam thickness*   |--- |  *Fixed*   |  *Removable*   |  *[mm]*   |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Longitudinal – alu floor  Longitudinal – GRP floor  | 2.0  1.5  | 3.0  2.0  | 25  25  |
| Transversal – alu floor  Transversal – GRP floor  | 2.0  1.5  | 3.2  2.6  | 40  40  |

K coefficients of movable dividing walls include a safety margin for specific ageing and unavoidable thermal leakages. For specific designs with additional heat transfer caused by additional thermal bridges compared to a standard design, the partition K coefficient shall be increased. 

8.3.8The requirements of section 8 shall not apply to equipment produced before the entry into force of the requirements and having undergone equivalent tests as multi-temperature equipment. Equipment produced before the entry into force of this section may be operated in international transport but may only be transferred from one country to another with the agreement of the competent authorities of the countries concerned.

### Annex 2 

####SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT AND TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED FOR THE CARRIAGE OF QUICK (DEEP)-FROZEN AND FROZEN FOODSTUFFS

1.For the carriage of the following quick (deep)-frozen and frozen foodstuffs, the transport equipment has to be selected and used in such a way that during carriage the highest temperature of the foodstuffs at any point of the load does not exceed the indicated temperature. By that means the equipment used for the transport of quick-frozen foodstuffs other than railway equipment shall be fitted with the device referred to in Appendix 1 to this Annex. If however one should proceed to the verification of the temperature of the foodstuff, this shall be done according to the procedure laid down in Appendix 2 to this Annex.

2.Accordingly, the foodstuffs at any point in the load must be at or below the indicated value on loading during carriage and on unloading.

3.Where it is necessary to open the equipment, e.g. to carry out inspections, it is essential to ensure that the foodstuffs are not exposed to procedures or conditions contrary to the objectives of this annex and those of the International Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods.

4.During certain operations, such as defrosting the evaporator of mechanically refrigerated equipment, a brief rise of the temperature of the surface of the foodstuffs of not more than 3° C in apart of the load, e.g. near the evaporator, above the appropriate temperature may be permitted.

|Ice cream ......................................................... |- 20° C |
|Frozen or quick (deep)-frozen fish, fish products, molluscs and crustaceans and all other quick (deep)-frozen foodstuffs .................................. |- 18°C |
|All other frozen foodstuffs (except butter) .................................. |- 12°C |
|Butter .................................................................... |- 10°C |

Deep-frozen and frozen foodstuffs, mentioned below to be immediately further processed at destination:<sup> 1)  The deep-frozen and frozen foodstuffs listed, when intended for immediate further processing at destination, may be permitted to gradually rise in temperature during carriage so as to arrive at destination at temperatures no higher than those specified by the sender and indicated in the transport contract. This temperature should not be higher than the maximum temperature authorized for the same foodstuff when refrigerated as mentioned in annex 3. The transport document shall state the name of the foodstuff, whether it is deep-frozen or frozen and that it is to be immediately further processed at destination. This carriage should be undertaken with ATP-approved equipment without use of the thermal appliance to increase the temperature of the foodstuffs. </sup>

Butter

Concentrated fruit juice  

###Annex 2 

####, Appendix 1, to ATP

Monitoring of air temperatures for transport of perishable foodstuffs quick-frozen 

The transport equipment shall be fitted with an instrument capable of measuring and recording air temperatures and storing the data obtained (hereinafter referred to as the instrument) to monitor the air temperatures to which quick-frozen foodstuffs intended for human consumption are subjected. The instrument shall be verified in accordance with EN 13486 (Temperature recorders and thermometers for the transport, storage and distribution of chilled, frozen, deep-frozen/quick-frozen food and ice cream – Periodic verification) by an accredited body and the documentation shall be available for the approval of ATP competent authorities. The instrument shall comply with standard EN 12830 (Temperature recorders for the transport, storage and distribution of chilled, frozen, deep-frozen/quick-frozen food and ice cream – Tests, performance, suitability). Temperature recordings obtained in this manner must be dated and stored by the operator for at least one year or longer, according to the nature of the food. 

###Annex 2 

####, Appendix 2, to ATP

Procedure for the Sampling and Measurement of Temperature for Carriage of Chilled, Frozen and Quick-frozen Perishable Foodstuffs 

###*A. General considerations*

1.Inspection and measurement of temperatures stipulated in Annexes 2 and 3 should be carried out so that the foodstuffs are not exposed to conditions detrimental to the safety or quality of the foodstuffs. Measuring of food temperatures should be carried out in a refrigerated environment, and with the minimum delays and minimum disruption of transport operations.

2.Inspection and measurement procedures, as referred to in paragraph 1, shall preferably be carried out at the point of loading or unloading. These procedures should not normally be carried out during transport, unless serious doubt exists about the conformity of the temperatures of the foodstuffs stipulated in Annexes 2 and 3.

3.Where possible, the inspection should take account of information provided by temperature monitoring devices during the journey before selecting those loads of perishable foodstuffs for sampling and measurement procedures. Progression to temperature measurement of the food should only be undertaken where there is reasonable doubt of the temperature control during carriage.

4.Where loads have been selected, a non-destructive measurement (between-case or between-pack) should at first be used. Only where the results of the non-destructive measurement do not conform with the temperatures laid down in Annexes 2 or 3 (taking into account allowable tolerances) are destructive measurements to be carried out. Where consignments or cases have been opened for inspection, but no further action has been taken, they should be resealed giving the time, date, place of inspection, and the official stamp of the inspection authority.
###*B. Sampling*

5.The types of package selected for temperature measurement shall be such that their temperature is representative of the warmest point of the consignment.

6.Where it is necessary to select samples during transport whilst the consignment is loaded, two samples should be taken from the top and bottom of the consignment adjacent to the opening edge of each door or pair of doors.

7.Where samples are taken during unloading of the consignment, four samples should be chosen from any of the following locations:

top and bottom of the consignment adjacent to the opening edge of the doors;

top rear corners of the consignment (ie furthest away from the refrigeration unit);

centre of the consignment;

centre of the front surface of the consignment (ie closest to the refrigeration unit);

top or bottom corners of the front surface of the consignment (ie closest to the return air intake of the refrigeration unit).

8.In the case of chilled foods in Annex 3, samples should also be taken from the coldest location to ensure that freezing has not occurred during transportation.
###*C. Temperature measurement of perishable foodstuffs*

9.The temperature measuring probe should be precooled to as close to the product temperature as possible before measurement.
###*I. Chilled foods*

10.*Non-destructive measurement.* Measurement between-case or between-pack should be made with a probe with a flat head, which gives a good surface contact, low thermal mass, and high thermal conductivity. When placing the probe between the cases or food packs, there should be sufficient pressure to give a good thermal contact, and sufficient length of probe inserted to minimise conductivity errors.

11.*Destructive measurement.* A probe with a rigid, robust stem and sharpened point should be used, made from a material which is easy to clean and disinfect. The probe should be inserted into the centre of the food pack, and the temperature noted when a steady reading is reached.
###*II. Frozen and quick-frozen foods*

12.*Non-destructive measurement.* Same as paragraph 10.

13.*Destructive measurement.* Temperature probes are not designed to penetrate frozen foods. Therefore it is necessary to make a hole in the product in which to insert the probe. The hole is made by a precooled product penetration instrument, which is a sharp pointed metallic instrument such as an ice punch, hand drill or an auger. The diameter of the hole should provide a close fit to that of the probe. The depth to which the probe is inserted will depend on the type of product:

(i)where product dimensions allow, insert the probe to a depth of 2.5 cm from the surface of the product;

(ii)where (i) is not possible because of the size of the product, the probe should be inserted to a minimum depth from the surface of 3 to 4 times the diameter of the probe;

(iii)it is not possible or practical to make a hole in certain foods because of their size or composition, eg diced vegetables. In these cases, the internal temperature of the food package should be determined by insertion of a suitable sharp-stemmed probe to the centre of the pack to measure the temperature in contact with the food.After inserting the probe, the temperature should be read when it has reached a steady value.
###*D. General specifications for the measuring system*

14.The measuring system (probe and read-out) used in determining temperature shall meet the following specifications:

(i)the response time should achieve 90% of the difference between the initial and final reading within three minutes;

(ii)<sup>*)The procedure will be defined.</sup> the system must have an accuracy of ± 0.5°C within the measurement range – 20°C to + 30°C;

(iii)<sup>*)The procedure will be defined.</sup> the measuring accuracy must not change by more than 0.3°C during operation in the ambient temperature range – 20°C + 30°C;

(iv)the display resolution of the instrument should be 0.1°C;

(v)<sup>*)The procedure will be defined.</sup> the accuracy of the system should be checked at regular intervals;

(vi)the system should have a current certificate of calibration from an approved institution;

(vii)the electrical components of the system should be protected against undesirable effects due to condensation of moisture;

(viii)the system should be robust and shock proof.
###*E. Allowable tolerances in the measurement of temperature*

15.Certain tolerances should be allowed in the interpretation of temperature measurements:

(i)*operational* – in the case of frozen and quick-frozen foods, a brief rise of up to 3°C on the temperature permitted in Annex 2 is allowed for the surface temperature of the food.

(ii)*methodology* – non-destructive measurement can give up to a maximum of 2°C difference in the reading compared to the true product temperature measurement, especially with the thickness of cardboard in case packaging. This tolerance does not apply to the destructive measurement of temperature.

### Annex 3 

####Selection of equipment and temperature conditions to be observed for the carriage of chilled foodstuffes

1. For the carriage of the following chilled foodstuffs, the transport equipment has to be selected and used in such a way that during carriage the highest temperature of the foodstuffs at any point of the load does not exceed the indicated temperature. If, however the verification of the temperature of the foodstuff is carried out, it shall be done according to the procedure laid down in Appendix 2 to Annex 2 to this Agreement.

2. Accordingly, the temperature of the foodstuffs at any point in the load must not exceed the temperature as indicated below on loading, during carriage and on unloading. 

3. Where it is necessary to open the equipment, e.g. to carry out inspections, it is essential to ensure that the foodstuffs are not exposed to procedures or conditions contrary to the objectives of this Annex and those of the International Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods.

4. The temperature control of foodstuffs specified in this Annex should be such as not to cause freezing at any point of the load.

8.

Indien de bevoegde instantie van een Overeenkomstsluitende Partij te kennen heeft gegeven dat, op grond van haar nationale recht, goedkeuring harentwege gebonden is aan een bijzondere machtiging of aan de goedkeuring van een wetgevend lichaam, wordt de goedkeuring van de betrokken Overeenkomstsluitende Partij met betrekking tot de wijziging van een Bijlage niet geacht te zijn gegeven alvorens de Overeenkomstsluitende Partij de Secretaris-Generaal ervan heeft verwittigd dat de vereiste machtiging of goedkeuring is verkregen. In de tussen de bevoegde instanties bereikte overeenstemming kan worden bepaald dat gedurende een overgangsperiode de oude Bijlagen, naast de nieuwe, geheel of gedeeltelijk van kracht zullen blijven. De Secretaris-Generaal bepaalt de datum waarop de uit dergelijke wijzigingen voortkomende nieuwe teksten van kracht worden.
