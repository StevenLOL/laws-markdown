####COMMERCIAL PROVISIONS

### Article  5  

####Prices

1.  Each Contracting Party shall allow Prices for air transportation to be established by each Designated airline based upon commercial considerations in the marketplace. Intervention by the Contracting Parties shall be limited to: 

a) prevention of unreasonably discriminatory Prices or practices;

5.  In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3 above is denied by the representative of that airline or airlines, the other Contracting Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 4 above arise and to draw the conclusions referred to in that paragraph.

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to suspend or vary the operating authorization of an airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party immediately in the event the first Contracting Party concludes, whether as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultations or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of the airline's operation.   
7.  Any action by one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 6 above shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.   
8.  Each Contracting Party shall provide or ensure the provision of communicative, aviation and meteorological facilities and any other services necessary for the safe operations of the Agreed services by the Designated airlines of either Contracting Party.

6.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the aviation security provisions of this Article, the Aeronautical authorities of the first Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the Aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request shall constitute grounds to withhold, revoke, limit or impose conditions on the operating authorization of an airlines or airlines of that other Contracting Party. When required by an emergency, a Contracting Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of these fifteen (15) days.
