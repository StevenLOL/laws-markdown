### Article  14bis  

####Safety

1.  Each Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning safety standards in any area relating to air crew, aircraft or their operation adopted by the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within 30 (thirty) days of that request.   
2.  If, following such consultations, one Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards and requirements in any such area that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Chicago Convention, the first Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and that other Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Contracting Party to take appropriate action within 15 (fifteen) days or such longer period as may be agreed, shall be grounds for the application of Article 5 (Revocation and suspension of authorization) of this Agreement.   
3.  Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in Article 33 of the Chicago Convention, it is agreed that any aircraft operated by or, under a lease agreement, on behalf of the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party on services to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party may, while within the territory of the other Contracting Party, be made the subject of an examination by the authorized representatives of the other Contracting Party, on board and around the aircraft, to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent conditions of the aircraft and its equipment (ramp inspections), provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.   
4.  If any such inspection or series of ramp inspections gives rise to: 

a) serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Chicago Convention, or  

b) serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Chicago Convention,   the Contracting Party carrying out the inspection shall, for the purposes of Article 33 of the Chicago Convention, be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificates or licenses in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that aircraft had been issued or rendered valid, or that the requirements under which that aircraft is operated, are not equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Chicago Convention.   
5.  In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3 above is denied by the representative of that airline or those airlines, the other Contracting Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 4 above arise and draw the conclusions referred to in that paragraph.   
6.  Each Contracting Party reserves the right to suspend or vary the operating authorization of an airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party immediately in the event the first Contracting Party concludes, whether as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultations or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of the airline’s operation.   
7.  Any action by one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 6 above shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.   

### Article  15  

####Security

1.  The Contracting Parties reaffirm, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law, that their obligations to each other to protect the security of civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference forms an integral part of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall in particular act in conformity with the provisions of the [Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/offences/and/certain/other/acts/committed/on/board/aircraft/BWBV0004659/README.md), signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the [Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/seizure/of/aircraft/BWBV0004424/README.md), signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the [Chicago Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/acts/against/the/safety/of/etc/BWBV0003604/README.md), signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, its [Supplementary Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/protocol/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/acts/of/violence/at/airports/etc/BWBV0002152/README.md), signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, and any other Convention on aviation security to which the Contracting Parties shall become Contracting Party.   
2.  The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.   
3.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards and, so far as they are applied by them, the Recommended Practices established by the International Civil Aviation Organization and designated as Annexes to the Convention; they shall require that operators of aircraft of their registry, operators who have their principal place of business or permanent residence in their territory, and the operators of airports in their territory, act in conformity with such aviation security provisions. In this paragraph the reference to aviation security standards includes any difference notified by the Contracting Party concerned.   
4.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet the increase in the threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that its designated airline(s) may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 required by the other Contracting Party for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall also act favorably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate as rapidly as possible commensurate with minimum risk to life such incident or threat.   
6.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within 30 (thirty) days of that request. These consultations shall be aimed to reach an agreement upon the measures suitable to eliminate the more immediate reasons of worry and to adopt in the framework of the ICAO security standards, the actions necessary to establish the appropriate conditions of security.   
7.  Each Contracting Party shall take such measures as it may find practicable, to ensure that an aircraft subject to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which has landed in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.   

### Article  16
