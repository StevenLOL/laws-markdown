### Article  7  

####Certificates, licences and safety

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Contracting Party and still in force, shall be recognised as valid by the other Contracting Party for the purpose of operating the agreed services on the routes specified in the Annex, provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, the standards established under the Convention. Each Contracting Party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognise, for the purpose of flights above its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by the other Contracting Party.   
2.  If the certificates or licences referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article were issued or rendered valid according to requirements different from the standards established under the Convention, and if such difference has been filed with the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party may request consultations in accordance with Article 17 of this Agreement with a view to satisfying themselves that the requirements in question are acceptable to them. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement in matters regarding flight safety will constitute grounds for the application of Article 5 of this Agreement.   
3.1.  Each Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning safety standards in any area relating to aircrew, aircraft or their operation adopted by the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of that request.   
3.2.  If, following such consultations, one Contracting Party finds that the other Contracting Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in any such area that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Contracting Party shall notify the other Contracting Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and that other Contracting Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Contracting Party to take appropriate action within fifteen (15) days or such longer period as may be agreed, shall be grounds for the application of Article 5 of this Agreement (revocation, suspension and variation of operating authorisations).   
3.3.  Notwithstanding the obligation mentioned in Article 33 of the Convention it is agreed that any aircraft operated or, under a lease arrangement, on behalf of the airline of one Party on services to or from the territory of another Contracting Party may, while within the territory of the other Contracting Party, be made the subject of an examination by the authorised representatives of the other Contracting Party, on board and around the aircraft to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent condition of the aircraft and its equipment (in this Article called “ramp inspection”), provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.   
3.4.  If any such ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections gives rise to: 

a) serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, or  

b) serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the Contracting Party carrying out the inspection shall, for the purposes of Article 33 of the Convention, be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificate or licences in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that aircraft had been issued or rendered valid, or that the requirements under which that aircraft is operated, are not equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the Convention.    
3.5.  In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by or on behalf of the airline or airlines of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3.3 above is denied by the representative of that airline or airlines, the other Contracting Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 3.4 above arise and draw the conclusions referred to in that paragraph.   
3.6.  Each Contracting Party reserves the right to suspend or vary the operating authorisation of an airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party immediately in the event the first Contracting Party concludes, whether as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultation or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of an airline operation.   
3.7.  Any action by one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraphs 3.2 or 3.6 above shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.  

### Article  8  

####Aviation Security

3.  The Contracting Parties shall act in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft, signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970 and the Convention for the Suppression of Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, and any other multilateral agreement governing civil aviation security binding upon the Contracting Parties.

5.  Each Contracting Party agrees to observe the security provisions required by the other Contracting Party for entry into, for departure from, and while within the territory of that other Contracting Party and to take adequate measures to protect aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew, their baggage and carry-on items, as well as cargo and aircraft stores, prior to boarding or loading. Each Contracting Party shall also give positive consideration to any request from the other Contracting Party for special security measures for its aircraft or passengers to meet a particular threat.   
6.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of passengers, crew, aircraft, airports and air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.   
7.  Should a Contracting Party depart from the aviation security provisions of this Article, the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the aeronautical authorities of that Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within thirty (30) days will constitute grounds for application of Article 5 of this Agreement.

3.  The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall bear reasonable relationship to the requirements of the public for transportation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of capacity adequate to meet the current and reasonably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail between the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline and the countries of ultimate destination of the traffic.   
4.  Provision for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail both taken up and discharged at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating an airline shall be made in accordance with the general principle that capacity shall be related to:

a) prevention of unreasonably discriminatory tariffs or practices;

c) protection of airlines from tariffs that are artificially low due to direct or indirect governmental subsidy or support.
