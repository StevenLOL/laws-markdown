a) the Netherlands Financial Institution treats each such Related Entity or branch as a separate Nonparticipating Financial Institution for purposes of all the reporting and withholding requirements of this Agreement and each such Related Entity or branch identifies itself to withholding agents as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution;  

b) each such Related Entity or branch identifies its U.S. accounts and reports the information with respect to those accounts as required under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to the extent permitted under the relevant laws pertaining to the Related Entity or branch; and  

c) such Related Entity or branch does not specifically solicit U.S. accounts held by persons that are not resident in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located or accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions that are not established in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located, and such Related Entity or branch is not used by the Netherlands Financial Institution or any other Related Entity to circumvent the obligations under this Agreement or under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as appropriate.     
6.  *Coordination of Timing*. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 3 of this Agreement: 

a) the Netherlands shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the calendar year with respect to which similar information is required to be reported to the IRS by participating FFIs pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations;  

b) the Netherlands shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which participating FFIs are required to report similar information to the IRS under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations;  

c) the United States shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the first calendar year with respect to which the Netherlands is required to obtain and exchange information; and  

d) the United States shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which the Netherlands is required to begin exchanging information.     
7.  *Coordination of Definitions with U.S. Treasury Regulations*. Notwithstanding Article 1 of this Agreement and the definitions provided in the Annexes to this Agreement, in implementing this Agreement the Netherlands may use, and may permit Netherlands Financial Institutions to use, a definition in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of a corresponding definition in this Agreement, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of this Agreement.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

### I  

####General.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

A. The Netherlands shall require that Reporting Netherlands Financial Institutions apply the due diligence procedures contained in this Annex I to identify U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions.  

B. For purposes of the Agreement, 

1. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars and shall be read to include the equivalent in other currencies.  

2. Except as otherwise provided herein, the balance or value of an account shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.  

3. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of June 30, 2014, under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of that day or the last day of the reporting period ending immediately before June 30, 2014, and where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a calendar year under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.

As an alternative to the procedures described in each section of this Annex I, the Netherlands may permit Reporting Netherlands Financial Institutions to rely on the procedures described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations to establish whether an account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. The Netherlands may permit Reporting Netherlands Financial Institutions to make such election separately for each section of this Annex I either with respect to all relevant Financial Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts (such as by line of business or the location of where the account is maintained).    

### II  

####Preexisting Individual Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Accounts held by individuals (“Preexisting Individual Accounts”). 

A. *Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported*. Unless the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in the Netherlands provide for such an election, the following Preexisting Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts:

3. A Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, provided the law or regulations of the Netherlands or the United States effectively prevent the sale of such a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract to U.S. residents (*e.g.*, if the relevant Financial Institution does not have the required registration under U.S. law, and the law of the Netherlands requires reporting or withholding with respect to insurance products held by residents of the Netherlands.  

4. A Depository Account with a balance of $50,000 or less.    

B. *Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value as of June 30, 2014, that Exceeds $50,000 ($250,000 for a Cash Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract), But Does Not Exceed $1,000,000 (“Lower Value Accounts”)*. 

1. *Electronic Record Search*. The Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution for any of the following U.S. indicia:

f) Currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address; or  

g) An “in-care-of” or “hold mail” address that is the *sole* address the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution has on file for the Account Holder. In the case of a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account, an “in-care-of” address outside the United States or “hold mail” address shall not be treated as U.S. indicia.    

2. If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account described in paragraph D of this section.  

3. If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

4. Notwithstanding a finding of U.S. indicia under subparagraph B(1) of this section, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is not required to treat an account as a U.S. Reportable Account if: 

a) Where the Account Holder information unambiguously indicates a *U.S. place of birth*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form);  

2. A non-U.S. passport or other government-issued identification evidencing the Account Holder’s citizenship or nationality in a country other than the United States; *and*  

3. A copy of the Account Holder’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States or a reasonable explanation of: 

a) The reason the Account Holder does not have such a certificate despite relinquishing U.S. citizenship; *or*  

b) The reason the Account Holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth.      

b) Where the Account Holder information contains a *current U.S. mailing or residence address, or one or more U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers associated with the account*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution obtains or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); *and*  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.    

c) Where the Account Holder information contains *standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); *and*  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.    

d) Where the Account Holder information contains *a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address, has an “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address identified for the Account Holder, or has one or more U.S. telephone numbers (if a non-U.S. telephone number is also associated with the account)*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); *or*  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.        

C. *Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Individual Accounts That Are Lower Value Accounts*. 

1. Review of Preexisting Individual Accounts that are Lower Value Accounts for U.S. indicia must be completed by June 30, 2016.  

2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless subparagraph B(4) of this section applies.  

3. Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.    

D. *Enhanced Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value That Exceeds $1,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, or December 31 of 2015 or Any Subsequent Year (“High Value Accounts”)*. 

1. *Electronic Record Search*. The Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section.  

2. *Paper Record Search*. If the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution’s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph D(3) of this section, then no further paper record search is required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section: 

a) The most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account;  

b) The most recent account opening contract or documentation;  

c) The most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes;  

d) Any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and  

e) Any standing instructions to transfer funds currently in effect.    

3. *Exception Where Databases Contain Sufficient Information*. A Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph D(2) of this section if the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution’s electronically searchable information includes the following: 

a) The Account Holder’s nationality or residence status;  

b) The Account Holder’s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution;  

c) The Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution;  

d) Whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution or another Financial Institution);  

e) Whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address for the Account Holder; *and*  

f) Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account.    

4. *Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge*. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat as a U.S. Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with such High Value Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person.  

5. *Effect of Finding U.S. Indicia*. 

a) If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a Specified U.S. Person in subparagraph D(4) of this section, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account.  

b) If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

c) Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.      

E. *Additional Procedures Applicable to High Value Accounts*. 

1. If a Preexisting Individual Account is a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account by June 30, 2015. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account on or before December 31, 2014, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to 2014 in the first report on the account and on an annual basis thereafter. In the case of an account identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after December 31, 2014, and on or before June 30, 2015, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is not required to report information about such account with respect to 2014, but must report information about the account on an annual basis thereafter.  

2. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, but becomes a High Value Account as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.  

3. Once a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section to a High Value Account, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph D(4) of this section, to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year.  

4. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

5. A Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in the United States, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section, is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder.    

F. *Preexisting Individual Accounts That Have Been Documented for Certain Other Purposes*. A Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution that has previously obtained documentation from an Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status as neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident in order to meet its obligations under a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its obligations under chapter 61 of Title 26 of the United States Code, is not required to perform the procedures described in subparagraph B(1) of this section with respect to Lower Value Accounts or subparagraphs D(1) through D(3) of this section with respect to High Value Accounts.    

### III  

####New Individual Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Financial Accounts held by individuals and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Individual Accounts”). 

A. *Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported*. Unless the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in the Netherlands provide for such an election, the following New Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 

1. A Depository Account unless the account balance exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.  

2. A Cash Value Insurance Contract unless the Cash Value exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.    

B. *Other New Individual Accounts*. With respect to New Individual Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, upon account opening (or within 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the account ceases to be described in paragraph A of this section), the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution to determine whether the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes (for this purpose, a U.S. citizen is considered to be resident in the United States for tax purposes, even if the Account Holder is also a tax resident of another jurisdiction) and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. 

1. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account and obtain a self-certification that includes the Account Holder’s U.S. TIN (which may be an IRS Form W-9 or other similar agreed form).  

2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes whether the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. tax purposes. If the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution is unable to obtain a valid self-certification, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.      

### IV  

####Preexisting Entity Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Preexisting Accounts held by Entities (“Preexisting Entity Accounts”). 

A. *Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported*. Unless the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in Netherlands provide for such an election, a Preexisting Entity Account with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a U.S. Reportable Account until the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000.  

B. *Entity Accounts Subject to Review*. A Preexisting Entity Account that has an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, and a Preexisting Entity Account that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, but the account balance or value of which exceeds $1,000,000 as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section.  

C. *Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required*. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Specified U.S. Persons, or by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, shall be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. In addition, accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions shall be treated as accounts for which aggregate payments as described in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement are reported to the Netherlands Competent Authority.  

D. *Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required*. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Specified U.S. Persons, by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, or by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions: 

1. *Determine Whether the Entity Is a Specified U.S. Person*. 

a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person includes a U.S. place of incorporation or organization, or a U.S. address.  

b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or a similar agreed form), or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Specified U.S. Person.    

2. *Determine Whether a Non-U.S. Entity Is a Financial Institution*. 

a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution.  

b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution, or the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account.    

3. *Determine Whether a Financial Institution Is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution Payments to Which Are Subject to Aggregate Reporting Under Subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement*. 

a) Subject to subparagraph D(3)(b) of this section, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution, as applicable. In such a case, no further review, identification, or reporting is required with respect to the account.  

b) If the Account Holder is a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.  

c) If the Account Holder is not a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution, then the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution payments to which are reportable under subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement, unless the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution:

4. *Determine Whether an Account Held by an NFFE Is a U.S. Reportable Account*. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account that is not identified as either a U.S. Person or a Financial Institution, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must identify (i) whether the Account Holder has Controlling Persons, (ii) whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, and (iii) whether any of the Controlling Persons of the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident. In making these determinations the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs D(4)(a) through D(4)(d) of this section in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. 

a) For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.  

b) For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE.  

c) For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident for tax purposes, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution may rely on: 

1. Information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that does not exceed $1,000,000; *or*  

2. A self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that exceeds $1,000,000.

E. *Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Entity Accounts*. 

1. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, must be completed by June 30, 2016.  

2. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, but exceeds $1,000,000 as of December 31 of 2015 or any subsequent year, must be completed within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000.  

3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that causes the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must redetermine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip   

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Financial Accounts held by Entities and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Entity Accounts”). 

A. *Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported*. Unless the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in the Netherlands provide for such election, a credit card account or a revolving credit facility treated as a New Entity Account is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported, provided that the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution maintaining such account implements policies and procedures to prevent an account balance owed to the Account Holder that exceeds $50,000.  

B. *Other New Entity Accounts*. With respect to New Entity Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is: (i) a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (iv) an Active NFFE or Passive NFFE. 

1. Subject to subparagraph B(2) of this section, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE, a Netherlands Financial Institution, or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution, as applicable.  

2. If the Account Holder is a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.  

3. In all other cases, a Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status. Based on the self-certification, the following rules apply: 

a) If the Account Holder is *a Specified U.S. Person*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.  

b) If the Account Holder is *a Passive NFFE*, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must identify the Controlling Persons as determined under AML/KYC Procedures, and must determine whether any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident on the basis of a self-certification from the Account Holder or such person. If any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident, the Reporting Netherlands Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.  

c) If the Account Holder is: (i) a U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) subject to subparagraph B(3)(d) of this section, a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; (iv) an Active NFFE; or (v) a Passive NFFE none of the Controlling Persons of which is a U.S. citizen or resident, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, and no reporting is required with respect to the account.  

d) If the Account Holder is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution (including a Netherlands Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution), then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.
