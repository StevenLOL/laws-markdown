Each Contracting Party shall also act favorably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall provide mutual assistance by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate as rapidly as possible, commensurate with minimum risk to life, such incident or threat.   
6.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of that request. These consultations will be aimed at reaching an agreement upon the measures suitable to eliminate the more immediate reasons of concern and at adopting, within the framework of the ICAO security standards, the actions necessary to establish the appropriate conditions of security.   
7.  Each Contracting Party shall take such measures, as it may find practicable, to ensure that an aircraft subject to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which has landed in its Territory, is retained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.
