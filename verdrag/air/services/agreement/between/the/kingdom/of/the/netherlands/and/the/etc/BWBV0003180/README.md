Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement could constitute grounds for the application of Article 20 of this Agreement.   
4.  The Contracting Parties shall act in conformity with any agreement effective between them regarding the suppression of acts of unlawful interference, inter alia in respect of aircraft in flight, aircraft in service and/or safety at airports.
