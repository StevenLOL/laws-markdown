In this paragraph the reference to aviation security standards includes any difference notified by the Contracting Party concerned.   
4.  Each Contracting Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its Territory to protect aircraft, to screen passengers and their carry-on items, and to carry out appropriate checks on crew, cargo (including hold baggage) and aircraft stores prior to and during boarding or loading and that those measures are adjusted to meet the increase in the threat. Each Contracting Party agrees that its Designated Airline(s) may be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 3 required by the other Contracting Party for entrance into, departure from, or while within, the Territory of that other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall also act favorably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
5.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate as rapidly as possible, commensurate with minimum risk to life, such incident or threat.   
6.  When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from the provisions of this Article, the first Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of that request. These consultations will be aimed to reach an agreement upon the measures suitable to eliminate the more immediate reasons of worry and to adopt in the framework of the ICAO security standards, the actions necessary to establish the appropriate conditions of security.   
7.  Each Contracting Party shall take such measures, as it may find practicable, to ensure that an aircraft subject to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which has landed in its Territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Wherever practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of mutual consultations.
