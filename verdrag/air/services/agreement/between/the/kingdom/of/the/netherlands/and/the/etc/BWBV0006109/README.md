Failure by the other Contracting Party to take appropriate action within fifteen (15) days or such longer period as may be agreed, shall be grounds for the application of Article 4 of this Agreement (Revocation and Suspension of Authorization).

Notwithstanding the obligations mentioned in [Article 33 of the Convention](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/international/civil/aviation/BWBV0005507/README.md) it is agreed that any Aircraft operated by or, under a lease arrangement, on behalf of the Airline or Airlines of one Contracting Party on Services to or from the Territory of the other Contracting Party may, while within the Territory of the other Contracting Party, be made the subject of an examination by the authorized representatives of the other Contracting Party, on board and around the aircraft, to check both the validity of the aircraft documents and those of its crew and the apparent conditions of the aircraft and its equipment (ramp inspections), provided this does not lead to unreasonable delay.

b) serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the [Convention](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/international/civil/aviation/BWBV0005507/README.md),   the Contracting Party carrying out the inspection shall, for the purpose of [Article 33 of the Convention](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/international/civil/aviation/BWBV0005507/README.md), be free to conclude that the requirements under which the certificate or licenses in respect of that aircraft or in respect of the crew of that aircraft had been issued or rendered valid, or that the requirements under which that aircraft is operated, are not equal to or above the minimum standards established pursuant to the [Convention](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/international/civil/aviation/BWBV0005507/README.md).   
5.  In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the Airline or Airlines of one Contracting Party in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article is denied by the representative of that Airline or Airlines, the other Contracting Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns of the type referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article arise and to draw the conclusions referred to in that paragraph.

Without limiting the generality of their rights and obligations under international law, the Contracting Parties shall in particular act in conformity with the provisions of the [Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/offences/and/certain/other/acts/committed/on/board/aircraft/BWBV0004659/README.md), signed at Tokyo on 14 September 1963, the [Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/seizure/of/aircraft/BWBV0004424/README.md), signed at The Hague on 16 December 1970, the [Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/acts/against/the/safety/of/etc/BWBV0003604/README.md), signed at Montreal on 23 September 1971, the [Montreal Supplementary Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/protocol/for/the/suppression/of/unlawful/acts/of/violence/at/airports/etc/BWBV0002152/README.md), signed at Montreal on 24 February 1988, the [Convention on the Marketing of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/the/marking/of/plastic/explosives/for/the/purpose/of/etc/BWBV0003003/README.md), signed at Montreal on 1 March 1991 and any aviation security agreement that becomes binding on both Contracting Parties.   
2.  The Contracting Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to prevent acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.   
3.  When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, their passengers and crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Contracting Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to terminate rapidly and safely such incident or threat thereof.   
4.  The Contracting Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security provisions established by the International Civil Aviation Organization and designated as [Annexes to the Convention](../../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/convention/on/international/civil/aviation/BWBV0005507/README.md) to the extent that such security provisions are applicable to the Contracting Parties. Each Contracting Party shall require that its Airlines and the operators of airports in its Territory act in conformity with such aviation security provisions.   
5.  Each Contracting Party agrees that its Airlines shall be required to observe the aviation security provisions referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article required by the other Contracting Party for entry into the Territory of that other Contracting Party. For departure from, or while within, the Territory of the Netherlands, Airlines shall be required to observe aviation security provisions in conformity with European Union law. For departure from, or while within, the Territory of Rwanda, Airlines shall be required to observe aviation security provisions in conformity with the law in force in that country, as well as African Union relevant regulations applicable to security. Each Contracting Party shall ensure that adequate security measures are effectively applied within its Territory to protect the aircraft and to inspect passengers, crew, carry-on items, baggage, cargo and aircraft Stores prior to and during boarding or loading, and that those measures are adjusted to meet any increased threat to the security of civil aviation. Each Contracting Party agrees that security provisions required by the other Contracting Party for departure from and while within the Territory of that other Contracting Party must be observed. Each Contracting Party shall also act favourably upon any request from the other Contracting Party for reasonable special security measures to meet a particular threat.   
6.  With full regard and mutual respect for each other’s sovereignty, a Contracting Party may adopt security measures for entry into its Territory. Where possible, that Contracting Party shall take into account the security measures already applied by the other Contracting Party and any views that the other Contracting Party may offer. Each Contracting Party recognises, however, that nothing in this Article limits the rights of a Contracting Party to refuse entry into its Territory of any flight of flights that it deems to present a threat to its security.   
7.  A Contracting Party may take emergency measures to meet a specific security threat. Such measures shall be notified immediately to the other Contracting Party.   
8.  Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect transport security, the Contracting Parties affirm that when considering security measures, a Contracting Party shall evaluate possible adverse effects on international air transport and, unless constrained by law, shall take such factors into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address those security concerns.   
9.  Each Contracting Party may request consultations at any time concerning security standards adopted by the other Contracting Party. Such Consultations shall take place within thirty (30) days of that request. When a Contracting Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Contracting Party has departed from provisions of this Article, that Contracting Party may request immediate consultations with the other Contracting Party. Failure to reach a satisfactory resolution within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request, shall constitute grounds to revoke, suspend or limit the operating authorisation and technical permissions of an Airline or Airlines of the other Contracting Party. When required by an emergency, a Contracting Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of fifteen (15) days.
