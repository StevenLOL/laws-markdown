####Mutual Agreement Procedure

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Where an entity considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for it in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, it may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present its case to either competent authority. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, or, if later, within six years from the end of the year or the chargeable period in respect of which that taxation is imposed or proposed.   
2.  The competent authority to whom the case has been presented shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States, except such limitations as apply for the purposes of giving effect to such an agreement.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any double charging of bank taxes in cases not provided for in the Convention as well as any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs.   
5.  Where, 

a) under paragraph 1 or 3, a case has been presented to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have either resulted for that entity in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, or in double charging of bank taxes in cases not provided for in this Convention, and  

b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 or 3 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State,   any unresolved issues arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration if an entity directly affected by the case so requests. Unless an entity directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.  

### Article  7  

####Exchange of Information

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Subject to the provisions of the domestic law of the Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning bank taxes, in particular, to prevent fraud and to facilitate the administration of statutory provisions against legal avoidance.   
2.  Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to entities or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the bank taxes or the oversight of the above. Such authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.   
3.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.     
4.  If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own bank tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.   
5.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a bank.  

### Article  8  

####Entry into Force
