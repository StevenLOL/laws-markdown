All material, equipment and supplies which are purchased from the resources of the Programme shall be used exclusively for the execution of the project, and shall remain the property of the Programme in whose name it shall be held by the Executing Agency. Arrangements may be made, if necessary, for a temporary transfer of custody of equipment to local authorities during the lifetime of the Programme, without prejudice to the final transfer. Prior to the completion of the Programme, the Participating Governments and the Executing Agency shall consult as to the disposition of all project equipment provided by the Programme. Title to such equipment shall normally be transferred to the Participating Governments or to entities nominated by them, when it is required for continued operation of the Programme or for activities following directly therefrom.

During the fourth stage of the Programme, the Participating Governments shall become increasingly involved in undertaking control activities in the context of devolution, including the provision of national staff at the operational disposal of the Programme.

### APPENDIX  II  

####PROGRAMME OBJECTIVE AND PLAN OF ACTION FOR THE PHASE 1992-1997

The objective of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme is to eliminate onchocerciasis as a disease of public health importance and as an obstacle to socioeconomic development throughout the Programme area and for the Participating Governments to maintain this achievement. To attain this objective, the Programme shall continue to pursue and develop a series of activities undertaken during the first three phases covering 1974-1991. To this end, it shall carry out the following activities laid down in the Long-Term Strategy and specified in the Plan of Operation for the fourth financial phase: 

a) organize aerial larviciding operations;  

b) carry out entomological surveillance of the treated areas;  

c) evaluate the operations by regular epidemiological surveillance;  

d) monitor the long-term safety of the larvicide treatment for the environment;  

e) organize and coordinate large-scale ivermectin distribution carried out by national teams;  

f) analyze and evaluate on a continuing basis epidemiological surveillance in areas exposed to larviciding for 14 years or more with a view to determining the dates when vector control may cease in such areas;  

g) undertake, in collaboration with the UNDP/World Bank/ WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, research towards finding a macrofilaricide suitable for large-scale application;  

h) prepare with the Participating Governments plans for the devolution of activities and assist them in assuming responsibility for these activities, as appropriate;  

i) train personnel as necessary for the Programme and for devolution; and  

j) collect, analyze and disseminate information regarding socioeconomic development in onchocerciasis-controlled zones within the Programme area in order to encourage such development, which may be actively supported by the Committee of Sponsoring Agencies.
