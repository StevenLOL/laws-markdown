Vienna, 15–31 May 1996 The Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Republic, the Republic of Belarus, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the French Republic, Georgia, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Hellenic Republic, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Iceland, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Kazakstan, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Moldova, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the Republic of Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America, which are the States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe of 19 November 1990, hereinafter referred to as the States Parties, Fulfilling the obligation set forth in Article XXI, paragraph 1, of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, hereinafter referred to as the Treaty, to conduct a review of the operation of the Treaty, and thereby taking into account the Final Documents of the Extraordinary Conferences of the States Parties of 10 July 1992 in Helsinki and 13 November 1992 in Vienna, Acting in accordance with the provision of Section VII, paragraph 3, of the Concluding Act of the Negotiation on Personnel Strength of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe of 10 July 1992, hereinafter referred to as the Concluding Act, Recalling the results of the Extraordinary Conferences held thus far, Reaffirming all the decisions of the Joint Consultative Group made thus far, Having met at the First Review Conference, chaired by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, from 15 to 31 May 1996 in Vienna, Have adopted the following:    

### I  

####INTRODUCTION

### 1  

The States Parties reaffirm the fundamental role of the Treaty as a cornerstone of European security and their adherence to its goals and objectives. It is in their common interest to preserve the integrity of the Treaty and the Concluding Act as well as the predictability and transparency they have created. The States Parties reaffirm their determination to fulfil in good faith all obligations and commitments arising from the Treaty and its associated documents. Bearing that in mind, they commit themselves to enhance the viability and effectiveness of the Treaty.  

### 2  

The negotiation, conclusion and implementation of the Treaty and the Concluding Act, as well as the ratification of the Treaty, took place in times of change during which the European security environment evolved significantly. The Warsaw Treaty Organization has ceased to exist. New States have emerged and became States Parties to the Treaty. At the same time, new risks and challenges to security have come to the fore. As a result of common efforts of the States Parties, the Treaty and the Concluding Act have remained vital stabilizing factors in this period of transition and contributed to its peaceful unfolding.  

### 3  

The States Parties stress that security and stability in Europe are vitally underpinned by the continuation and enhancement of robust arms control measures. Recognizing the evolution of the European political and security environment, the States Parties are resolved to continue the conventional arms control process, including through the enhancement of the viability and effectiveness of the Treaty. They see this as a common responsibility.  

### 4  

The States Parties recognize that the Treaty and the Concluding Act are essential contributions to the achievement of the goals and purposes of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in particular the promotion of confidence, stability and security in an undivided Europe. In that context, they stress the importance of the development of a common and comprehensive security model for Europe for the twenty-first century, of the implementation of the Treaty on Open Skies and of the ongoing security dialogue and negotiations in the Forum for Security Co-operation.  

### II  

####REVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF THE TREATY AND THE CONCLUDING ACT

### 5  

The States Parties note with satisfaction that more than 58,000 pieces of conventional armaments and equipment have been reduced, and that the overall holdings of conventional armaments and equipment within the area of application are substantially lower than the limits set in the Treaty. More than 2,500 inspections have taken place. A permanent system for regular and routine exchange of Treaty notifications and other information has been developed. The Joint Consultative Group has been firmly established and has demonstrated its utility and importance as the ongoing Treaty forum. With regard to the Concluding Act, the States Parties note with satisfaction that the personnel strength of conventional armed forces in the area of application was reduced by 1.2 million persons.  

### 6  

The States Parties note that the Treaty established a high degree of transparency in military relations through its comprehensive system for exchange of information and for verification. Together with the extensive reductions of conventional armaments and equipment, this has led to greater predictability and confidence in security relations. The Treaty has also nurtured the development of new patterns of co-operation in Europe and provides a basis for stability and enhanced security in Europe at substantially lower levels of conventional armaments and equipment than heretofore. Although risks and challenges still exist in some parts of Europe, the capability for launching surprise attack and the danger of large-scale offensive action in Europe as a whole have been diminished substantially. Nevertheless, the achievement of the goals of the Treaty in the whole area of its application requires continuous efforts by the States Parties.  

### 7  

The States Parties reaffirm the continued relevance of the basic structures of the Treaty, including the principle of zonal limitations, as embodied in Articles IV and V of the Treaty. In this respect, and in line with the Decision of the Joint Consultative Group of 17 November 1995, the States Parties have agreed on a Document, which is contained in Annex A, reflecting a combination of measures agreed in co-operative fashion and acceptable to all Parties to the Treaty.  

### 8  

The States Parties regret that not all reduction obligations pursuant to the Treaty have been met. They stress the necessity to complete as soon as possible reductions of conventional armaments and equipment limited by the Treaty (TLE) in accordance with obligations under the Treaty. They note with satisfaction the reiterated commitment of those States Parties which still have to complete reductions to comply with the provisions of the Treaty and its associated documents. All States Parties express their readiness to follow this process to its completion in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. In this context, being aware of difficulties which have delayed the completion of reductions, they take positive note of efforts undertaken in order to meet fully obligations under the Treaty.  

### 9  

The States Parties express their concern with serious difficulties of some States Parties to comply fully, within their territory, with the provisions of the Treaty and its related documents due to TLE unaccounted for and uncontrolled within the Treaty. This situation adversely affects the operation of the Treaty and complicates its implementation. They stress the need to reach as soon as possible relevant political solutions and to elaborate necessary measures to enable the implementation of the Treaty in accordance with its provisions. They express their readiness to address the issue of this TLE in the Joint Consultative Group, including the ways and means to facilitate the resolution of this issue.  

### 10  

The States Parties have adopted the understandings and agreed interpretations with regard to implementation and ways and means to improve the viability and effectiveness of the Treaty as specified in Annex B of this Final Document.  

### 11  

The States Parties have agreed that the implementation issues contained in Annex C of this Final Document require further consideration and resolution in the Joint Consultative Group.  

### 12  

The States Parties reaffirm the arrangements regarding Article XII reached at the Extraordinary Conference in Oslo in 1992. They understand that for successor States that had become States Parties by 1992, paragraph 2 of the Article XII part of the Oslo arrangement should be read as: “In particular, no State Party will increase within the area of application its holdings of armoured infantry fighting vehicles held by organizations designed and structured to perform in peacetime internal security functions above that aggregate number held by such organizations at the time of signature of the Treaty, as notified on their territory pursuant to the information exchange as of November 19, 1990." They agree to work further on the issue of Article XII in the Joint Consultative Group, taking into account the proposals made at the Review Conference.  

### 13  

The States Parties stressed the importance of full and continuous respect for the provisions of Article IV, paragraph 5, in the context of maintaining the viability of the Treaty, as well as for the sovereignty of the States Parties involved. The States Parties noted that, in certain instances, bilateral agreements are under negotiation – or in the process of ratification or implementation – which relate to the provisions of Article IV, paragraph 5. The States Parties expressed their support for early and positive results of the ongoing process. The States Parties consider that the importance of the Article IV provisions on stationing forces should be recognized in the context of the process foreseen in Section III of this Final Document.  

### 14  

In the context of the process foreseen in Section I II of this Final Document, the States Parties will examine different interpretations of temporary deployments so as to ensure that these temporary deployments do not become indefinite.  

### 15  

The States Parties recall that, according to Article II, paragraph 2, of the Treaty, the lists of existing types contained in the Protocol on Existing Types of Conventional Armaments and Equipment (POET) shall be updated periodically by the Joint Consultative Group in accordance with Section IV of the POET. However, it has not been updated since the Treaty's conclusion. The States Parties instruct their delegations to the Joint Consultative Group to update the POET. They further agreed that: 

– any inaccuracies should be corrected, including by removal of types, models and versions of conventional armaments and equipment that do not meet Treaty criteria;  

– the Joint Consultative Group should consider if a yearly update of the lists would be appropriate;  

– the Joint Consultative Group should consider an electronic version of the lists in all official languages.    

### 16  

The States Parties also discussed the topics contained in Annex D of this Final Document.  

### 17  

The States Parties welcome the statement of the representative of the Russian Federation to promote the implementation of the statement of the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Joint Consultative Group on 14 June 1991 in Vienna. The text of the Russian statement is given in Annex E of this Final Document.  

### 18  

The States Parties recommend that, in view of the issues that have been referred to the Joint Consultative Group, most effective use is made of the provisions of Article XVI and the Protocol on the Joint Consultative Group in order to allow the Joint Consultative Group to address all those issues in a proper manner.  

### III  

####FUTURE WORK ON THE TREATY

### 19  

In view of Sections I and II of this Final Document, the States Parties instruct their delegations to the Joint Consultative Group to expand upon their work in accordance with Article XVI of the Treaty. Taking fresh impetus from this Review Conference, they will immediately start a thorough process aimed at improving the operation of the Treaty in a changing environment and, through that, the security of each State Party, irrespective of whether it belongs to a politico-military alliance. As part of this process, the States Parties will consider measures and adaptations with the aim of promoting the objectives of the Treaty and of enhancing its viability and effectiveness, including but not limited to the consideration of proposals already made to that effect. The character of this process should be such as to permit the Treaty to sustain its key role in the European security architecture. Its scope and parameters should be defined as a matter of priority.  

### 20  

Until the entry into force of such measures and adaptations, the States Parties will observe all provisions of the Treaty and its associated documents.  

### 21  

The States Parties will consider a progress report on the intermediate results of this process at the time of the OSCE Lisbon Summit. That report will, *inter alia,* include recommendations on the way ahead.  

In accordance with Article XXI, paragraph 1, the States Parties look forward to gathering again in five years' time at the Second Conference to Review the Operation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. This Final Document, together with its Annexes A, B, C, D and E, which are integral to it, having been drawn up in all the official languages of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, shall be deposited with the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as the designated Depositary for the Treaty, which shall circulate copies of this Final Document to all States Parties.

### Annex  E:  

###Statement of the representative of the Russian Federation

To promote the implementation of the Statement of the Representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Joint Consultative Group of 14 June 1991 (the Statement of the Soviet Representative), I have been instructed by the Government of the Russian Federation to state the following.  

### 1  

It is understood that conventional armaments and equipment in the three Treaty limited categories referred to in paragraph 1 of the Statement of the Soviet Representative (battle tanks, armoured combat vehicles, artillery) will be deemed destroyed or rendered militarily unusable, in accordance with that Statement, upon the application of any of the following methods: 

A) Destruction or conversion of conventional armaments and equipment under procedures that provide sufficient visible evidence, which confirms that they have been destroyed or rendered militarily unusable;  

B) Provision of satisfactory documentary evidence as meeting requirements of sufficient visible evidence, only in case of such armaments and equipment destroyed prior to promulgation of this Statement. The Russian Federation intends to provide such documentary evidence with regard to armaments and equipment destroyed in the area of application of the Treaty after 17 November 1995;  

C) Segregation of battle tanks and armoured combat vehicles exposed to the influence of atmospheric factors, with hatches and covers of engine compartments opened, with the invitation of a group of experts to conduct – at its own expense – an examination of a random sample representative of those conventional armaments and equipment, prior to their removal from a display site for final disposal (scrapping), and notification of such removal;  

D) Visit of group of experts, at its own expense and upon invitation, to count already derelict conventional armaments and equipment;  

E) Notification preceding or accompanying each transfer of conventional armaments and equipment to other States Parties within the area of application of the Treaty, with equivalent relevant notification from the recipient State Party. Such transfers will be done in line with Treaty provisions and will be compatible with objectives and terms of the Statement of the Soviet Representative.    

### 2  

Continuing its efforts aimed at the implementation of the Statement of the Soviet Representative, the Russian Federation will apply methods referred to in paragraph 1 of this Statement to conventional armaments and equipment located on its territory. It will co-operate with the Republic of Kazakstan and the Republic of Uzbekistan in applying those methods to conventional armaments and equipment located on their territories. The Russian Federation will negotiate the necessary arrangements with those States for the purpose of completing by joint efforts the process referred to in paragraph 1 of the Statement of the Soviet Representative by the year 2000.  

### 3  

If, despite good faith efforts, the quota of 6,000 battle tanks subject to elimination is not fully met, the shortfall of not more than 2,300 battle tanks will be covered by applying methods referred to in paragraph 1 of this Statement to an equal number of armoured combat vehicles in excess of the quota of 1,500 pieces; and thus the overall process referred to in paragraph 1 of the Statement of the Soviet Representative will be in general deemed completed. Notwithstanding that, a number of battle tanks equal to the above-mentioned shortfall will be subsequently eliminated. The envisaged date for the completion of the process of their elimination will depend on the duration of their operational and service life and on the availability of financial resources. That elimination will be carried out in line with paragraph 1 of this Statement.  

### 4  

Upon completion of initial visits referred to in paragraph 1 of this Statement, the Russian Federation will be ready to discuss in the JCG their results and in the light of these to make arrangements, as necessary, for further visits, as well as to discuss possible modalities for further visits. In general, relevant practices established in the process of Treaty implementation will be followed as much as applicable in the organization and conduct of the visits.  

###Statements of the Chairman of the First Conference to Review the Operation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe and the Concluding Act of the Negotiation on Personnel Strength:

– Notwithstanding the rights of each State as stated in Article XIV of the Treaty, each State Party should attempt to avoid conducting inspections during the officially recognized holidays of the other State Party.
