(2) Holders of valid Pakistan passports shall be free to travel to the Netherlands from any place whatever without the necessity of obtaining a visa.  

(3) It is understood that the waiver of the visa requirement does not exempt holders of valid Netherlands and Pakistan passports coming to Pakistan and the Netherlands respectively from the necessity of complying with the Pakistan and the Netherlands laws and regulations concerning the entry, residence (temporary or permanent) and employment or occupation of foreigners. It is also understood that the above waiver does not prevent leave to entry being refused by either Government to travellers who are unable to satisfy the immigration authorities that their cases comply with these laws and regulations.
