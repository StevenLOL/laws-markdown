1.  This Agreement shall be in force for a period of six months. It shall automatically be prolonged by periods of one year, unless one Party informs the other Party by Diplomatic Note at least one month before its termination of its decision to denounce this Agreement.   
2.  Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, this Agreement shall cease to be in force at the date on which the headquarters agreement concluded between the Court and the Kingdom of the Netherlands shall enter into force.
