### No.  I  

###ROYAL NETHERLANDS EMBASSY

No. 1038 Tokyo, May 15th 1956. Monsieur le Ministre, With reference to the exemption of visa requirements for the nationals of The Netherlands and Japan, I have the honour to state that the following is the understanding of the Government of The Netherlands: 

1. Japanese and Netherlands nationals shall be free to travel from any place whatever to The Netherlands (territory in Europe) and Japan respectively without the necessity of obtaining a visa in advance, provided that they are furnished with valid passports issued by the country of which they are nationals and provided that the duration of their stay shall not exceed a period of three consecutive months.  

2. It is understood that the waiver of the visa requirement does not exempt Japanese and Netherlands nationals from the necessity of complying with the Netherlands and Japanese laws and regulations on aliens. Either Government reserves the right to refuse entry into and residence in its territory to nationals considered undesirable.  

3. Japanese and Netherlands nationals travelling to The Netherlands and Japan respectively with the intention of staying there for a period exceeding three months, or seeking employment or occupation shall not benefit by the provision sub 1 of this Arrangement. However, the visa for them shall be obtained free of charge.  

4. After the approval constitutionally required in The Netherlands has been obtained, the present Arrangement shall enter into force on the date ten days after receipt by the Japanese Government of a relevant notification from the Netherlands Government.  

5. Either Party may at any time give to the other Party written notice of its desire to terminate the Arrangement. The Arrangement shall be terminated one month after the date of such notice.   I have further the honour to request Your Excellency to be good enough to confirm on behalf of Your Government that this is also the understanding of the Government of Japan. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency, Monsieur le Ministre, the assurances of my highest consideration. (sd.) O. REUCHLIN  *His Excellency*   *Mr. Mamoru Shigemitsu,*   *Minister for Foreign Affairs*   *of Japan.*
