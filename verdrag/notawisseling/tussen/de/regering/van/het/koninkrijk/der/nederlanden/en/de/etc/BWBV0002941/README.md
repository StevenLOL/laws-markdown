###EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

No. 59 The Embassy of the United States of America at The Hague presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and has the honour to refer to the consultations between representatives of the Governments of the United States of America and the Kingdom of the Netherlands relating to the selection of De Nederlandsche Bank at Amsterdam by the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America as a mutually agreeable central bank within the meaning of the Declaration of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria of 19 January 1981. During the course of these consultations a number of rules have been drawn up relating to the foregoing matter, with the intention of incorporating them in a host State convention to be concluded with the Kingdom of the Netherlands on behalf of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal. However, it would appear to be desirable, in anticipation of the conclusion in due course of the more comprehensive convention, to lay down the rules in question in a separate agreement. If the selection of De Nederlandsche Bank as well as the relevant rules, set out in the Annex to this Note, are acceptable to the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Embassy proposes that this Note together with the affirmative Note of reply of the Ministry constitute an Agreement between the United States of America and the Kingdom of the Netherlands which shall enter into force on the date of the Note of reply.

The Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, having been requested by the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States of America to serve as an intermediary in seeking a mutually acceptable resolution of the crisis in their relations arising out of the detention of the 52 United States nationals in Iran, has consulted extensively with the two governments as to the commitments which each is willing to make in order to resolve the crisis within the framework of the four points stated in the resolution of November 2, 1980, of the Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran. On the basis of formal adherences received from Iran and the United States, the Government of Algeria now declares that the following interdependent commitments have been made by the two governments: 
###GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The undertakings reflected in this Declaration are based on the following general principles: 

A. Within the framework of and pursuant to the provisions of the two Declarations of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, the United States will restore the financial position of Iran, in so far as possible, to that which existed prior to November 14, 1979. In this context, the United States commits itself to ensure the mobility and free transfer of all Iranian assets within its jurisdiction, as set forth in Paragraphs 4-9.  

B. It is the purpose of both parties, within the framework of and pursuant to the provisions of the two Declarations of the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria, to terminate all litigation as between the Government of each party and the nationals of the other, and to bring about the settlement and termination of all such claims through binding arbitration. Through the procedures provided in the Declaration, relating to the Claims Settlement Agreement, the United States agrees to terminate all legal proceedings in United States courts involving claims of United States persons and institutions against Iran and its state enterprises, to nullify all attachments and judgments obtained therein, to prohibit all further litigation based on such claims, and to bring about the termination of such claims through binding arbitration.   
### *Point I: Non-intervention in Iranian Affairs* 

1. The United States pledges that it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran's internal affairs.   
### *Points II and III: Return of Iranian Assets and Settlements of U.S. Claims* 

2. Iran and the United States (hereinafter "the parties") will immediately select a mutually agreeable central bank (hereinafter "the Central Bank") to act, under the instructions of the Government of Algeria and the Central Bank of Algeria (hereinafter "the Algerian Central Bank") as depositary of the escrow and security funds hereinafter prescribed and will promptly enter into depositary arrangements with the Central Bank in accordance with the terms of this declaration. All funds placed in escrow with the Central Bank pursuant to this declaration shall be held in an account in the name of the Algerian Central Bank. Certain procedures for implementing the obligations set forth in this Declaration and in the Declaration of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria concerning the settlement of claims by the Government of the United States and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (hereinafter "the Claims Settlement Agreement") are separately set forth in certain Undertakings of the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran with respect to the Declaration of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria.  

3. The depositary arrangements shall provide that, in the event that the Government of Algeria certifies to the Algerian Central Bank that the 52 U.S. nationals have safely departed from Iran, the Algerian Central Bank will thereupon instruct the Central Bank to transfer immediately all monies or other assets in escrow with the Central Bank pursuant to this declaration, provided that at any time prior to the making of such certification by the Government of Algeria, each of the two parties, Iran and the United States, shall have the right on seventy-two hours notice to terminate its commitments under this declaration. If such notice is given by the United States and the foregoing certification is made by the Government of Algeria within the seventy-two hour period of notice, the Algerian Central Bank will thereupon instruct the Central Bank to transfer such monies and assets. If the seventy-two hour period of notice by the United States expires without such a certification having been made, or if the notice of termination is delivered by Iran, the Algerian Central Bank will thereupon instruct the Central Bank to return all such monies and assets to the United States, and thereafter the commitments reflected in this declaration shall be of no further force and effect.

Commencing upon completion of the requisite escrow arrangements with the Central Bank, the United States will bring about the transfer to the Central Bank of all gold bullion which is owned by Iran and which is in the custody of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, together with all other Iranian assets (or the cash equivalent thereof) in the custody of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to be held by the Central Bank in escrow until such time as their transfer or return is required by Paragraph 3 above.

De Regeringen van de Islamitische Republiek Iran en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika, geleid door de wens een aantal bepalingen van de Verklaring van de Regering van de Democratische Volksrepubliek Algerije van 19 januari 1981 uit te voeren, hebben De Nederlandsche Bank te Amsterdam als een voor beide partijen aanvaardbare centrale bankinstelling uitgekozen om het beheer op zich te nemen van een bank die zal optreden als Depositaris van de gelden, gestort op het Garantiefonds dat bij bovengenoemde Verklaring is ingesteld.

### Artikel  5  

De gelden die in het Garantiefonds zijn gestort en de gelden die vervolgens door de Depositaris bij derden zijn gedeponeerd, zijn in geen enkele Overeenkomstsluitende Staat vatbaar voor beslaglegging.
