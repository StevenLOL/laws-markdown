*3.1* The choice and performance of equipment to be used in a station and any emissions therefrom shall satisfy the provisions of these Regulations.  *3.2* Also, as far as is compatible with practical considerations, the choice of transmitting, receiving and measuring equipment shall be based on the most recent advances in the technique as indicated, *inter alia*, in ITU-R Recommendations.  *3.3* Transmitting and receiving equipment intended to be used in a given part of the frequency spectrum should be designed to take into account the technical characteristics of transmitting and receiving equipment likely to be employed in neighbouring and other parts of the spectrum, provided that all technically and economically justifiable measures have been taken to reduce the level of unwanted emissions from the latter transmitting equipment and to reduce the susceptibility to interference of the latter receiving equipment.  *3.4* To the maximum extent possible, equipment to be used in a station should apply signal processing methods which enable the most efficient use of the frequency spectrum in accordance with the relevant ITU-R Recommendations. These methods include, *inter alia*, certain bandwidth expansion techniques, and in particular, in amplitude-modulation systems, the use of the single-sideband technique.  *3.5* Transmitting stations shall conform to the frequency tolerances specified in Appendix *2*.  *3.6* Transmitting stations shall conform to the maximum permitted power levels for unwanted emissions in the spurious domain specified in Appendix *3*. (WRC-12)  *3.7* Transmitting stations shall conform to the maximum permitted power levels for out-of-band emissions, or unwanted emissions in the out-of-band domain, specified for certain services and classes of emission in the present Regulations. In the absence of such specified maximum permitted power levels transmitting stations should, to the maximum extent possible, satisfy the requirements relating to the limitation of the out-of-band emissions, or unwanted emissions in the out-of-band domain, specified in the relevant ITU-R Recommendations. (WRC-12)  *3.8* Moreover, every effort should be made to keep frequency tolerances and levels of unwanted emissions at the lowest values which the state of the technique and the nature of the service permit.  *3.9* The bandwidths of emissions also shall be such as to ensure the most efficient utilization of the spectrum; in general this requires that bandwidths be kept at the lowest values which the state of the technique and the nature of the service permit. Appendix *1* is provided as a guide for the determination of the necessary bandwidth.  *3.10* Where bandwidth-expansion techniques are used, the minimum spectral power density consistent with efficient spectrum utilization shall be employed.  *3.11* Wherever necessary for efficient spectrum use, the receivers used by any service should comply as far as possible with the frequency tolerances of the transmitters of that service, due regard being paid to the Doppler effect where appropriate. *3.12* Receiving stations should use equipment with technical characteristics appropriate for the class of emission concerned; in particular, selectivity should be appropriate having regard to No. *3.9* on the bandwidths of emissions.  *3.13* The performance characteristics of receivers should be adequate to ensure that they do not suffer from interference due to transmitters situated at a reasonable distance and which operate in accordance with these Regulations.  *3.14* To ensure compliance with these Regulations, administrations shall arrange for frequent checks to be made of the emissions of stations under their jurisdiction. For this purpose, they shall use the means indicated in Article *16*, if required. The technique of measurements and the intervals of measurements to be employed shall be, as far as is practicable, in accordance with the most recent ITU-R Recommendations.  *3.15* The use of damped wave emissions is forbidden in all stations.

####Assignment and use of frequencies

Wordt voorlopig toegepast per 01-01-2013 

*4.1* Member States shall endeavour to limit the number of frequencies and the spectrum used to the minimum essential to provide in a satisfactory manner the necessary services. To that end they shall endeavour to apply the latest technical advances as soon as possible (CS 195).  *4.2* Member States undertake that in assigning frequencies to stations which are capable of causing harmful interference to the services rendered by the stations of another country, such assignments are to be made in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations and other provisions of these Regulations.  *4.3* Any new assignment or any change of frequency or other basic characteristic of an existing assignment (see Appendix *4*) shall be made in such a way as to avoid causing harmful interference to services rendered by stations using frequencies assigned in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations in this Chapter and the other provisions of these Regulations, the characteristics of which assignments are recorded in the Master International Frequency Register.  *4.4* Administrations of the Member States shall not assign to a station any frequency in derogation of either the Table of Frequency Allocations in this Chapter or the other provisions of these Regulations, except on the express condition that such a station, when using such a frequency assignment, shall not cause harmful interference to, and shall not claim protection from harmful interference caused by, a station operating in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Convention and these Regulations.  *4.5* The frequency assigned to a station of a given service shall be separated from the limits of the band allocated to this service in such a way that, taking account of the frequency band assigned to a station, no harmful interference is caused to services to which frequency bands immediately adjoining are allocated.  *4.6* For the purpose of resolving cases of harmful interference, the radio astronomy service shall be treated as a radiocommunication service. However, protection from services in other bands shall be afforded the radio astronomy service only to the extent that such services are afforded protection from each other.  *4.7* For the purpose of resolving cases of harmful interference, the space research (passive) service and the earth exploration-satellite (passive) service shall be afforded protection from different services in other bands only to the extent that these different services are protected from each other.  *4.8* Where, in adjacent Regions or sub-Regions, a band of frequencies is allocated to different services of the same category (see Sections I and II of Article *5*), the basic principle is the equality of right to operate. Accordingly, the stations of each service in one Region or sub-Region must operate so as not to cause harmful interference to any service of the same or higher category in the other Regions or sub-Regions. (WRC-03)  *4.9* No provision of these Regulations prevents the use by a station in distress, or by a station providing assistance to it, of any means of radiocommunication at its disposal to attract attention, make known the condition and location of the station in distress, and obtain or provide assistance.  *4.10* Member States recognize that the safety aspects of radionavigation and other safety services require special measures to ensure their freedom from harmful interference; it is necessary therefore to take this factor into account in the assignment and use of frequencies.  *4.11* Member States recognize that among frequencies which have long-distance propagation characteristics, those in the bands between 5 MHz and 30 MHz are particularly useful for long-distance communications; they agree to make every possible effort to reserve these bands for such communications. Whenever frequencies in these bands are used for short- or medium-distance communications, the minimum power necessary shall be employed.  *4.12* To reduce requirements for frequencies in the bands between 5 MHz and 30 MHz and thus to prevent harmful interference to long-distance radiocommunications, administrations are encouraged to use, whenever practicable, any other possible means of communication.  *4.13* When special circumstances make it indispensable to do so, an administration may, as an exception to the normal methods of working authorized by these Regulations, have recourse to the special methods of working enumerated below, on the sole condition that the characteristics of the stations still conform to those inserted in the Master International Frequency Register: *4.14 * *a)* a station in the fixed service or an earth station in the fixed-satellite service may, under the conditions defined in Nos. *5.28* to *5.31*, transmit to mobile stations on its normal frequencies;  *4.15 * *b)* a land station may communicate, under the conditions defined in Nos. *5.28* to *5.31*, with fixed stations in the fixed service or earth stations in the fixed-satellite service or other land stations of the same category.  *4.15A* (SUP - WRC-12)  *4.16* However, in circumstances involving the safety of life, or the safety of a ship or aircraft, a land station may communicate with fixed stations or land stations of another category.  *4.17* Any administration may assign a frequency in a band allocated to the fixed service or allocated to the fixed-satellite service to a station authorized to transmit, unilaterally, from one specified fixed point to one or more specified fixed points provided that such transmissions are not intended to be received directly by the general public.  *4.18* Any mobile station using an emission which satisfies the frequency tolerance applicable to the coast station with which it is communicating may transmit on the same frequency as the coast station on condition that the latter requests such transmission and that no harmful interference is caused to other stations.  *4.19* In certain cases provided for in Articles *31* and *51*, aircraft stations are authorized to use frequencies in the bands allocated to the maritime mobile service for the purpose of communicating with stations of that service (see No. *51.73*). (WRC-07)  *4.20* Aircraft earth stations are authorized to use frequencies in the bands allocated to the maritime mobile-satellite service for the purpose of communicating, via the stations of that service, with the public telegraph and telephone networks.  *4.21* In exceptional cases, land mobile earth stations in the land mobile-satellite service may communicate with stations in the maritime mobile-satellite and aeronautical mobile-satellite services. Such operations shall comply with the relevant provisions of the Radio Regulations relating to those services and shall be subject to agreement among administrations concerned, taking due account of No. *4.10*.  *4.22* Any emission capable of causing harmful interference to distress, alarm, urgency or safety communications on the international distress and emergency frequencies established for these purposes by these Regulations is prohibited. Supplementary distress frequencies available on less than a worldwide basis should be afforded adequate protection.  *4.23* Transmissions to or from high altitude platform stations shall be limited to bands specifically identified in Article *5*.

On the basis of the foregoing, the following principles shall be applied.  *12.3* § 2 All broadcasting requirements, formulated by administrations, shall be taken into account and treated on an equitable basis, so as to guarantee the equality of rights referred to in No. *12.2*, and to enable each administration to provide a satisfactory service.  *12.4* § 3 The Procedure shall be based solely on the broadcasting requirements expected to become operational during the schedule period. It shall furthermore be flexible in order to take into account new broadcasting requirements and modifications to existing broadcasting requirements.  *12.5* § 4 All broadcasting requirements, national<sup> 79)  * 12.5.1* An HF broadcasting requirement is considered as being for the purposes of national coverage when the transmitting station and its associated required service area are both located within the territory of the same country. </sup> and international, shall be treated on an equal basis, with due consideration of the differences between these two kinds of broadcasting requirements.  *12.6* § 5 In the Procedure, an attempt shall be made to ensure, as far as practicable, continuity of use of a frequency or of a frequency band.  *12.7* § 6 The Procedure shall be based on double-sideband or single-sideband emissions. Other modulation techniques recommended by ITU-R shall be permitted in place of double-sideband or single-sideband emissions, provided that the level of interference caused to existing emissions is not increased.  *12.8* § 7 To promote efficient spectrum use, the number of frequencies used shall be the minimum necessary to provide a satisfactory quality of reception. Whenever practicable, only one frequency should be used.  *12.9* § 8 The Procedure shall include a technical analysis, as specified in the Radio Regulations Board Rules of Procedure.  *12.10* § 9 The Procedure should encourage administrations or broadcasters empowered to make changes to pursue a continual coordination process to resolve incompatibilities, at meetings (regional<sup> 80)  * 12.10.1* The word “regional” in this Article is not related to the ITU Regions. </sup> or worldwide, bilateral or multilateral) or by correspondence.  *12.11* § 10 Regional coordination groups, which will facilitate bilateral and multilateral coordination among administrations and broadcasters in various regions of the world, shall identify themselves to the Bureau. Administrations and broadcasters shall be urged to participate in the relevant regional coordination groups. However, such participation would be on a voluntary basis.  *12.12* § 11 When an administration, in particular the administration of a developing country, requests assistance in the application of the Procedure, the Bureau shall take appropriate action, including, if need be, coordination of the requirements submitted by the requesting administration.  *12.13* § 12 The regional coordination groups should follow the coordination procedures prescribed in Section III. In the process of coordinating broadcasting requirements, an attempt shall be made to obtain agreement to the maximum number of submitted requirements with the quality level acceptable to administrations or broadcasters.  *12.14* § 13 In order to ensure maximum success from the Procedure, administrations and broadcasters shall show the utmost goodwill and mutual cooperation, and give due consideration to all the relevant technical and operational factors involved.

####– The Procedure

Wordt voorlopig toegepast per 01-01-2013 

*12.15* The application of the Procedure shall be facilitated and coordinated by the Bureau as defined elsewhere in this Article.  *12.16* Twice yearly, administrations shall submit their projected seasonal broadcasting schedules in the relevant frequency bands to the Bureau. These schedules shall cover the following seasonal periods:  *12.17* Schedule A: Last Sunday in March to last Sunday in October.  *12.18* Schedule B: Last Sunday in October to last Sunday in March.  *12.19* Implementation of these schedules shall start at 0100 UTC.  *12.20* If an administration considers it necessary to take account of propagation changes during the schedule period, it is recommended, for reasons of spectrum efficiency, that such requirements should be implemented on the following dates:  *12.21* first Sunday in May;  *12.22* first Sunday in September.  *12.23* Implementation of these changes shall start at 0100 UTC on these dates.  *12.24* Other start and stop dates within a schedule period may be used to accommodate requirements that have different schedule periods, e.g. special events, clock changes on different dates not coincident with the schedule period, etc.  *12.25* Administrations may include assignments in their schedules up to one year in advance of their use.  *12.26* In those cases where an administration does not indicate its requirements for a new seasonal schedule, the Bureau shall use the assignments from the previous corresponding seasonal schedule for this administration for the new schedule period. A note in the schedule shall be used to identify such requirements. The Bureau shall follow this practice for two consecutive schedule periods.  *12.27* Following the action taken in No. *12.26*, the Bureau shall notify the administration concerned that the schedule will not include their broadcasting requirements unless the administration advises otherwise.  *12.28* When an administration decides to cease its broadcasting service in the HF bands, it shall notify the Bureau of that decision.  *12.29* The frequencies in the schedules should be those that will be used during the season concerned, and should be the minimum number required to provide satisfactory reception of the programmes in each of the areas and for each of the periods intended. In each schedule, to the maximum possible extent, the frequencies to be used in each reception area should remain unchanged from season to season.  *12.30* Administrations are encouraged to coordinate their schedules with other administrations as far as possible prior to submission. An administration may, on behalf of a group of administrations, submit their coordinated schedules, the frequencies of which shall however have no priority for use over those submitted by other administrations.  *12.31* The closing dates for receipt by the Bureau of the schedules relating to the two seasons referred to in No. *12.17* and *12.18* shall be established and published by the Bureau.  *12.32* The schedules shall be submitted with the relevant data as specified in Appendix *4*.  *12.33* Upon receipt of the schedules, the Bureau shall, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, validate the data where necessary, perform a compatibility analysis and prepare the tentative high frequency broadcasting schedules (the Tentative Schedules). These Schedules shall include all assignments where administrations gave no alternatives, the selections made by the Bureau from any alternatives given, and the frequencies selected by the Bureau in cases where the need for its assistance was indicated by their intentional omission from the individual schedules. (WRC-03)  *12.34* The Tentative Schedules shall be published two months and one month before the start of each of the two schedule periods in Nos. *12.17* and *12.18*. (WRC-03)  *12.35* Administrations should examine the Tentative Schedule and should coordinate their frequency schedules to resolve or to minimize, as far as possible, any incompatibilities identified by the compatibility analysis, or by the monitoring results of similar assignments, or by a combination of both.  *12.36* Coordination shall be achieved through bilateral or multilateral meetings of administrations or broadcasters or other means acceptable to the parties concerned.  *12.37* Administrations, either jointly or separately, shall inform the Bureau, as quickly as possible, but no later than two weeks prior to the start of the schedule period, of any changes to their requirements resulting from the coordination process. The Bureau shall prepare a new consolidated high frequency broadcasting schedule (the Schedule), and shall perform a new compatibility analysis. The Bureau shall publish the Schedule and the results of the compatibility analysis at the start of the relevant broadcasting season.  *12.38* Administrations shall notify the Bureau of changes to their schedules as quickly as possible and the Bureau shall update and make available the Schedule on a monthly basis. The Bureau shall perform new compatibility analyses and publish the updated Schedule and the results of these analyses at regular intervals during the season. (WRC-03)  *12.39* To facilitate the coordination process, the Bureau shall also forward the schedules to the regional coordination groups.  *12.40* Regional coordination groups should consider communicating with administrations and broadcasters through the use of any appropriate, mutually agreeable means, such as e-mail, news-groups, bulletin boards and other forms of electronic data transfer.  *12.41* Each regional coordination group should consider appointing a steering committee to ensure smooth progress of the coordination process.  *12.42* During and after the coordination process, the regional coordination groups shall exchange schedule data among themselves with a view to further enhancing the efficacy of the coordination process.  *12.43* One month after the end of a season, the Bureau shall publish the final high frequency broadcasting schedule (the Final Schedule). If any changes have been notified to the Bureau since the previous consolidated Schedule, the Bureau shall also perform a compatibility analysis and publish it with the Final Schedule.  *12.44* The Bureau should, as and when required, convene joint meetings of the representatives of all the regional coordination groups to develop strategies for further reduction of incompatibilities and to discuss related matters. The outcome of these meetings shall be circulated among the regional groups and administrations.  *12.45* In a case of harmful interference involving the application of the provisions of Article *15*, administrations are urged to exercise the utmost goodwill and mutual cooperation, taking into account all the relevant technical and operational factors of the case.

*15.22* § 14 It is essential that Member States exercise the utmost goodwill and mutual assistance in the application of the provisions of Article *45* of the Constitution and of this Section to the settlement of problems of harmful interference.  *15.23* § 15 In the settlement of these problems, due consideration shall be given to all factors involved, including the relevant technical and operating factors, such as: adjustment of frequencies, characteristics of transmitting and receiving antennas, time sharing, change of channels within multichannel transmissions.  *15.24* § 16 For the purpose of this Section, the term “administration” may include the centralizing office designated by the administration, in accordance with No. *16.3*.  *15.25* § 17 Administrations shall cooperate in the detection and elimination of harmful interference, employing where appropriate the facilities described in Article *16* and the procedures detailed in this Section.  *15.26* § 18 Where practicable, and subject to agreement by administrations concerned, the case of harmful interference may be dealt with directly by their specially designated monitoring stations or by direct coordination between their operating organizations.  *15.27* § 19 Full particulars relating to harmful interference shall, whenever possible, be given in the form indicated in Appendix *10*.  *15.28* § 20 Recognizing that transmissions on distress and safety frequencies and frequencies used for the safety and regularity of flight (see Article *31* and Appendix *27*) require absolute international protection and that the elimination of harmful interference to such transmissions is imperative, administrations undertake to act immediately when their attention is drawn to any such harmful interference. (WRC-07)  *15.29* § 21 In cases of harmful interference where rapid action is required, communications between administrations shall be transmitted by the quickest means available and, subject to prior authorization by the administrations concerned in such cases, information may be exchanged directly between specially designated stations of the international monitoring system.  *15.30* § 22 When a case of such harmful interference is reported by a receiving station, it shall give to the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with all possible information which will assist in determining the source and characteristics of the interference.  *15.31* § 23 If a case of harmful interference so justifies, the administration having jurisdiction over the receiving station experiencing the interference shall inform the administration having jurisdiction over the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with, giving all possible information.  *15.32* § 24 If further observations and measurements are necessary to determine the source and characteristics of and to establish the responsibility for the harmful interference, the administration having jurisdiction over the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with may seek the cooperation of other administrations, particularly of the administration having jurisdiction over the receiving station experiencing the interference, or of other organizations.  *15.33* § 25 When cases of harmful interference occur as a result of emissions from space stations, the administrations having jurisdiction over these interfering stations shall, upon request from the administration having jurisdiction over the station experiencing the interference, furnish current ephemeral data necessary to allow determination of the positions of the space stations when not otherwise known.  *15.34* § 26 Having determined the source and characteristics of the harmful interference, the administration having jurisdiction over the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with shall inform the administration having jurisdiction over the interfering station, giving all useful information in order that this administration may take such steps as may be necessary to eliminate the interference.  *15.35* § 27 On being informed that a station over which it has jurisdiction is believed to have been the cause of harmful interference, an administration shall, as soon as possible, acknowledge receipt of that information by the quickest means available. Such acknowledgement shall not constitute an acceptance of responsibility. (WRC-2000)  *15.36* § 28 When a safety service suffers harmful interference the administration having jurisdiction over the receiving station experiencing the interference may also approach directly the administration having jurisdiction over the interfering station. The same procedure may also be followed in other cases with the prior approval of the administration having jurisdiction over the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with.  *15.37* § 29 An administration receiving a communication to the effect that one of its stations is causing harmful interference to a safety service shall promptly investigate the matter and take any necessary remedial action and respond in a timely manner. (WRC-2000)  *15.38* § 30 When the service rendered by an earth station suffers harmful interference, the administration having jurisdiction over the receiving station experiencing such interference may also approach directly the administration having jurisdiction over the interfering station.  *15.39* § 31 If the harmful interference persists in spite of the action taken in accordance with the procedures outlined above, the administration having jurisdiction over the transmitting station whose service is being interfered with may address to the administration having jurisdiction over the interfering station a report of irregularity or infraction in accordance with the provisions of Section V.  *15.40* § 32 If there is a specialized international organization for a particular service, reports of irregularities and of infractions relating to harmful interference caused or suffered by stations in this service may be addressed to such organization at the same time as to the administration concerned.  *15.41* § 33 1) If it is considered necessary, and particularly if the steps taken in accordance with the procedures described above have not produced satisfactory results, the administration concerned shall forward details of the case to the Bureau for its information.  *15.42* 2) In such a case, the administration concerned may also request the Bureau to act in accordance with the provisions of Section I of Article *13*; but it shall then supply the Bureau with the full facts of the case, including all the technical and operational details and copies of the correspondence.  *15.43* § 34 1) In the case where an administration has difficulty in identifying a source of harmful interference in the HF bands and urgently wishes to seek the assistance of the Bureau, it shall promptly inform the Bureau.  *15.44* 2) On receipt of this information, the Bureau shall immediately request the cooperation of appropriate administrations or specially designated stations of the international monitoring system that may be able to help in identifying the source of harmful interference.  *15.45* 3) The Bureau shall consolidate all reports received in response to requests under No. *15.44* and, using such other information as it has available, shall promptly attempt to identify the source of harmful interference.  *15.46* 4) The Bureau shall thereafter forward its conclusions and recommendations to the administration reporting the case of harmful interference.

*19.1* § 1 All transmissions shall be capable of being identified either by identification signals or by other means<sup> 83)  * 19.1.1* In the present state of the technique, it is recognized nevertheless that the transmission of identifying signals for certain radio systems (e.g. radiodetermination, radio relay systems and space systems) is not always possible. </sup>.  *19.2* § 2 1) All transmissions with false or misleading identification are prohibited.  *19.3* 2) Where practicable and in appropriate services, identification signals should be automatically transmitted in accordance with relevant ITU-R Recommendations.  *19.4* 3) All transmissions in the following services should, except as provided in Nos. *19.13* to *19.15*, carry identification signals:  *19.5 * *a)* amateur service;  *19.6 * *b)* broadcasting service;  *19.7 * *c)* fixed service in the bands below 28 000 kHz;  *19.8 * *d)* mobile service;  *19.9 * *e)* standard frequency and time signal service.  *19.10 * 4) All operational transmissions by radiobeacons shall carry identification signals. However, it is recognized that, for radiobeacons and for certain other radionavigation services that normally carry identification signals, during periods of malfunction or other non-operational service the deliberate removal of identification signals is an agreed means of warning users that the transmissions cannot safely be used for navigational purposes.  *19.11* 5) All transmissions by satellite emergency position-indicating radiobeacons (EPIRBs) operating in the band 406-406.1 MHz or the band 1 645.5-1 646.5 MHz, or by EPIRBs using digital selective calling techniques, shall carry identification signals.  *19.12* 6) When identification signals are transmitted they shall comply with the provisions of this Article.  *19.13* 7) However, the requirements for certain transmissions to carry identification signals need not apply to:  *19.14 * *a)* survival craft stations when transmitting distress signals automatically;  *19.15 * *b)* emergency position-indicating radiobeacons (except for those in No. *19.11*).  *19.16* § 3 In transmissions carrying identification signals a station shall be identified by a call sign, by a maritime mobile service identity or by other recognized means of identification which may be one or more of the following: name of station, location of station, operating agency, official registration mark, flight identification number, selective call number or signal, selective call identification number or signal, characteristic signal, characteristic of emission or other clearly distinguishing features readily recognized internationally.  *19.17* § 4 For transmissions carrying identification signals, in order that stations may be readily identified, each station shall transmit its identification as frequently as practicable during the course of transmissions, including those made for tests, adjustments or experiments. During such transmissions, however, identification signals shall be transmitted at least hourly, preferably within the period from five minutes before to five minutes after the hour (UTC) unless to do so would cause unreasonable interruption of traffic, in which case identification shall be given at the beginning and end of transmissions.  *19.18* § 5 Identification signals shall wherever practicable be in one of the following forms:  *19.19 * *a)* speech, using simple amplitude or frequency modulation;  *19.20 * *b)* international Morse code transmitted at manual speed;  *19.21 * *c)* a telegraph code compatible with conventional printing equipment;  *19.22 * *d)* any other form recommended by the Radiocommunication Sector.  *19.23* § 6 To the extent possible the identification signal should be transmitted in accordance with relevant ITU-R Recommendations.  *19.24* § 7 Administrations should ensure that wherever practicable superimposed identification methods be employed in accordance with ITU-R Recommendations.  *19.25* § 8 When a number of stations work simultaneously in a common circuit, either as relay stations, or in parallel on different frequencies, each station shall, as far as practicable, transmit its own identification or those of all the stations concerned.  *19.26* § 9 Administrations shall ensure, except in the cases mentioned in Nos. *19.13* to *19.15*, that all transmissions not carrying identification signals can be identified by other means when they are capable of causing harmful interference to the services of another administration operating in accordance with these Regulations.  *19.27* § 10 Administrations shall, having regard to the provisions of these Regulations relating to the notification of assignments for recording in the Master Register, adopt their own measures to ensure compliance with the provisions of No. *19.26*.  *19.28* § 11 Each Member State reserves the right to establish its own measures for identifying its stations used for national defence. However, it shall use, as far as possible, call signs recognizable as such, and containing the distinctive characters of its nationality.

*19.28A* § 11A 1) For the purpose of the supply of identification signals, a *territory* or *geographical area* shall be understood to mean the territory within the limits of which the station is located. For mobile stations, it shall be understood to mean the territory within the limits of which the responsible administration is located. A territory which does not have full responsibility for its international relations shall also be considered as a geographical area for this purpose.  *19.28B* 2) In all documents of the Union where the terms *allocation* of call sign series and *assignment* of call signs are to be used, they shall be used with the following meaning:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
|  *Identification means*   |  *Terms used in these Regulations*   |
| International series of call signs (including maritime identification digits (MIDs) and selective call numbers)  | Allocation to the administration of a Member State (see definition in No. 1002 of the Constitution)  |
| Call signs (including maritime identification digits (MIDs) and selective call numbers)  | Assignment by any administration to stations operating in a territory or geographical area (see No. *19.28A*)  |

*19.29* § 12 1) All stations open to international public correspondence, all amateur stations, and other stations which are capable of causing harmful interference beyond the boundaries of the territory or geographical area in which they are located, shall have call signs from the international series allocated to its administration as given in the Table of Allocation of International Call Sign Series in Appendix *42*.  *19.30* 2) As the need arises, ship stations and ship earth stations to which the provisions of Chapter *IX* apply, and coast stations, coast earth stations, or other non-shipborne stations capable of communicating with such ship stations, shall have assigned to them maritime mobile service identities in accordance with Section VI of this Article. (WRC-07)  *19.31* 3) It is not compulsory to assign call signs from the international series to stations identified by maritime mobile service identities or which are easily identified by other means (see No. *19.16*) and whose signals of identification or characteristics of emission are published in international documents.  *19.31A* 4) Means shall be provided for uniquely identifying mobile stations operating in automated terrestrial or satellite communication systems for the purposes of answering distress calls, for avoiding interference and for billing. Identification of the mobile station by accessing a registration database is satisfactory, provided that the system can associate the mobile station calling number with the particular mobile station user. (WRC-03)  *19.32* § 13 Should the available call sign series in Appendix *42* be exhausted, new call sign series may be allocated according to the principles set out in Resolution *13 (Rev.WRC-97)* relating to the formation of call signs and the allocation of new international series.  *19.33* § 14 Between radiocommunication conferences, the Secretary-General is authorized to deal with questions relating to changes in the allocation of series of call signs, on a provisional basis, and subject to confirmation by the following conference (see also No. *19.32*).  *19.34* § 15 The Secretary-General shall be responsible for allocating maritime identification digits (MIDs) to administrations and shall regularly publish information regarding allocated MIDs.  *19.35* § 16 The Secretary-General shall be responsible for allocating additional maritime identification digits (MIDs) to administrations within the limits specified, provided that it is ascertained that the possibilities offered by the MIDs allocated to an administration will soon be exhausted despite judicious ship station identity assignment as outlined in Section VI. (WRC-03)  *19.36* § 17 Each administration has been allocated one or more maritime identification digit (MID) for its use. A second or subsequent MID should not be requested<sup> 84)  * 19.35.1* (SUP - WRC-03)  * 19.36.1* In no circumstances may an administration claim more MIDs than the total number of its ship stations notified to ITU divided by 1 000, plus one. Administrations shall make every attempt to reuse the Maritime Mobile Service Identities (MMSI) assigned from earlier MID resources, which become redundant after ships leave their national ship registry. Such numbers should be considered for reassignment after being absent from at least two successive editions of List V of the ITU service publications. Administrations seeking additional MID resources must meet the criteria of having notified all previous assignments, in accordance with No. *20.16*. This criteria applies only to MMSIs in the basic category and to all MIDs assigned to the administration. (WRC-07) </sup> unless the previously allocated MID is more than 80% exhausted in the basic category of three trailing zeros and the rate of assignments is such that 90% exhaustion is foreseen. (WRC-03)  *19.37* § 18 The Secretary-General shall be responsible for supplying series of selective call numbers or signals (see Nos. *19.92* to *19.95*) at the request of the administrations concerned.  *19.38* § 19 1) Each administration shall choose the call signs from the international series allocated or supplied to it; and shall notify this information to the Secretary-General together with the information which is to appear in Lists I, IV and V. These notifications do not include call signs assigned to amateur and experimental stations. (WRC-07)  *19.39* 2) Each administration shall choose the maritime mobile service identities of its stations from the maritime identification digits allocated to it and notify this information to the Secretary-General for inclusion in the relevant lists, as provided for in Article *20*.  *19.40* 3) The Secretary-General shall ensure that the same call sign, the same maritime mobile service identity, the same selective call number or the same identification number is not assigned more than once and that call signs which might be confused with distress signals, or with other signals of the same nature, are not assigned.  *19.41* § 20 1) When a fixed station uses more than one frequency in the international service, each frequency may be identified by a separate call sign used solely for this frequency.  *19.42* 2) When a broadcasting station uses more than one frequency in the international service, each frequency may be identified by a separate call sign used solely for this frequency or by some other appropriate means, such as announcing the name of the place and frequency used.  *19.43* 3) When a land station uses more than one frequency, each frequency may, if desired, be identified by a separate call sign.  *19.44* 4) Where practicable, coast stations should use a common call sign for each frequency series<sup> 85)  *19.44.1* By “frequency series” is meant a group of frequencies each of which belongs to one of the different bands between 4 000 kHz and 27 500 kHz that are allocated exclusively to the maritime mobile service. </sup>.

In accordance with No. *20.16*, administrations shall notify the Radiocommunication Bureau immediately when assigning maritime mobile service identities. (WRC-12)  *19.100* § 40 1) Maritime mobile service identities are formed of a series of nine digits which are transmitted over the radio path in order to uniquely identify ship stations, ship earth stations, coast stations, coast earth stations, and other non-shipborne stations operating in the maritime mobile service or the maritime mobile-satellite service, and group calls. (WRC-07)  *19.101* 2) These identities are formed in such a way that the identity or part thereof can be used by telephone and telex subscribers connected to the public telecommunications network principally to call ships automatically in the shore-to-ship direction. Access to public networks may also be achieved by means of free-form numbering plans, so long as the ship can be uniquely identified using the system’s registration database (see No. *19.31A*) to obtain the ship station identity, call sign or ship name and nationality. (WRC-03)  *19.102* 3) The types of maritime mobile service identities shall be as described in Annex 1 of Recommendation ITU-R M.585-6.

In some cases, M<sub>1</sub>I<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> may denote a geographical area under the responsibility of a specific administration. Furthermore, as indicated in Recommendation ITU-R M.585, some maritime identification digits are reserved for maritime devices and do not correspond either to an administration or to a geographical area.

a) The distress alert is a digital selective call (DSC) using a distress call format, in the bands used for terrestrial radiocommunication, or a distress message format, in which case it is relayed through space stations.  

b) The distress call is the initial voice or text procedure.  

c) The distress message is the subsequent voice or text procedure.  

d) The distress alert relay is a DSC transmission on behalf of another station.  

e) The distress call relay is the initial voice or text procedure for a station not itself in distress. (WRC-07)    *32.2* § 2 1) The distress alert shall be sent through a satellite either with absolute priority in general communication channels, on exclusive distress and safety frequencies reserved for satellite EPIRBs in the Earth-to-space direction or on the distress and safety frequencies designated in the MF, HF and VHF bands for digital selective calling (see Appendix *15*). (WRC-07)  *32.2A* 1A) The distress call shall be sent on the distress and safety frequencies designated in the MF, HF and VHF bands for radiotelephony. (WRC-07) *32.3* 2) The distress alert or call and subsequent messages shall be sent only on the authority of the person responsible for the ship, aircraft or other vehicle carrying the mobile station or the mobile earth station. (WRC-07)  *32.4* § 3 All stations which receive a distress alert or call transmitted on the distress and safety frequencies in the MF, HF and VHF bands shall immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering with distress traffic and prepare for subsequent distress traffic. (WRC-07)  *32.5* § 4 Distress alerts or distress alert relays using DSC should use the technical structures and content set forth in the most recent version of Recommendations ITU-R M.493 and ITU-R M.541.

(WRC-07)  *32.13* § 9 1) Ship-to-ship distress alerts are used to alert other ships in the vicinity of the ship in distress and are based on the use of digital selective calling in the VHF and MF bands. Additionally, the HF band may be used. (WRC-07)  *32.13A* 2) Ship stations equipped for digital selective calling procedures may transmit a distress call and distress message immediately following the distress alert in order to attract attention from as many ship stations as possible. (WRC-07)  *32.13B* 3) Ship stations not equipped for digital selective calling procedures shall, where practical, initiate the distress communications by transmitting a radio telephony distress call and message on the frequency 156.8 MHz (VHF channel 16). (WRC-07)  *32.13BA* § 9A The radiotelephone distress signal consists of the word MAYDAY pronounced as the French expression “m’aider”.

– the nature of the distress;  

– the kind of assistance required;  

– any other useful information. (WRC-12)    *32.13E* § 9C DSC procedures use a combination of automated functions and manual intervention to generate the appropriate distress call format in the most recent version of Recommendation ITU-R M.541. A distress alert sent by DSC consists of one or more distress alert attempts in which a message format is transmitted identifying the station in distress, giving its last recorded position and, if entered, the nature of the distress. In MF and HF bands, distress alert attempts may be sent as a single-frequency attempt or a multi-frequency attempt on up to six frequencies within one minute. In VHF bands, only single-frequency call attempts are used. The distress alert will repeat automatically at random intervals, a few minutes apart, until an acknowledgement sent by DSC is received.

*32.21* § 13 1) Acknowledgement of receipt of a distress alert, including a distress alert relay, shall be made in the manner appropriate to the method of transmission of the alert and within the time-scale appropriate to the role of the station in receipt of the alert. Acknowledgement by satellite shall be sent immediately. (WRC-07)  *32.21A* 2) When acknowledging receipt of a distress alert sent by DSC<sup> 119)  * 32.21A.1* In order to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs before the shore-based authorities become aware of a distress incident, the acknowledgement by DSC to a distress alert sent by DSC shall normally only be made by a coast station or a rescue coordination centre. An acknowledgement by DSC will cancel any further automated repetition of the distress alert using DSC. (WRC-07) </sup>, the acknowledgement in the terrestrial services shall be made by DSC, radiotelephony or narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy as appropriate to the circumstances, on the associated distress and safety frequency in the same band in which the distress alert was received, taking due account of the directions given in the most recent versions of Recommendations ITU-R M.493 and ITU-R M.541. (WRC-07)  *32.21B* Acknowledgement by DSC of a distress alert sent by DSC addressed to stations in the maritime mobile service shall be addressed to all stations8. (WRC-07)  *32.22* (SUP - WRC-07)  *32.23* § 15 1) When acknowledging by radiotelephony the receipt of a distress alert or a distress call from a ship station or a ship earth station, the acknowledgement should be given in the following form, taking into account Nos. *32.6* and *32.7*: 

– the distress signal “MAYDAY”;  

– the name followed by the call sign, or the MMSI or other identification of the station sending the distress message;  

– the words “THIS IS”;  

– the name and call sign or other identification of the station acknowledging receipt;  

– the word “RECEIVED”;  

– the distress signal “MAYDAY”. (WRC-12)    *32.24* 2) When acknowledging by narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy the receipt of a distress alert from a ship station, the acknowledgement should be given in the following form: 

– the distress signal “MAYDAY”;  

– the call sign or other identification of the station sending the distress alert;  

– the characters “DE”;  

– the call sign or other identification of the station acknowledging receipt of the distress alert;

*32.28* § 19 1) Ship or ship earth stations in receipt of a distress alert or a distress call shall, as soon as possible, inform the master or person responsible for the ship of the contents of the distress alert. (WRC-07)  *32.29* 2) In areas where reliable communications with one or more coast stations are practicable, ship stations in receipt of a distress alert or a distress call from another vessel should defer acknowledgement for a short interval so that a coast station may acknowledge receipt in the first instance. (WRC-07)  *32.29A* 3) Ship stations in receipt of a distress call sent by radiotelephony on the frequency 156.8 MHz (VHF channel 16) shall, if the call is not acknowledged by a coast station or another vessel within five minutes, acknowledge receipt to the vessel in distress and use any means available to relay the distress call to an appropriate coast station or coast earth station (see also Nos. *32.16* to *32.19F*). (WRC-07)  *32.30* § 20 1) Ship stations operating in areas where reliable communications with a coast station are not practicable which receive a distress alert or call from a ship station which is, beyond doubt, in their vicinity, shall, as soon as possible and if appropriately equipped, acknowledge receipt to the vessel in distress and inform a rescue coordination centre through a coast station or coast earth station (see also Nos. *32.16* to *32.19H*). (WRC-07)  *32.31* 2) However, in order to avoid making unnecessary or confusing transmissions in response, a ship station, which may be at a considerable distance from the incident, receiving an HF distress alert, shall not acknowledge it but shall observe the provisions of Nos. *32.36* to *32.38*, and shall, if the distress alert is not acknowledged by a coast station within five minutes, relay the distress alert, but only to an appropriate coast station or coast earth station (see also Nos. *32.16* to *32.19H*). (WRC-07)  *32.32* § 21 A ship station acknowledging receipt of a distress alert sent by DSC should, in accordance with No. *32.29* or No. *32.30*: (WRC-07)  *32.33 * *a)* in the first instance, acknowledge receipt of the distress alert by using radiotelephony on the distress and safety traffic frequency in the band used for the alert, taking into account any instructions which may be issued by a responding coast station; (WRC-07)  *32.34 * *b)* if acknowledgement by radiotelephony of the distress alert received on the MF or VHF distress alerting frequency is unsuccessful, acknowledge receipt of the distress alert by responding with a digital selective call on the appropriate frequency.  *32.34A* § 21A However, unless instructed to do so by a coast station or a rescue coordination centre, a ship station may only send an acknowledgement by DSC in the event that: 

a) no acknowledgement by DSC from a coast station has been observed; and  

b) no other communication by radiotelephony or narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy to or from the vessel in distress has been observed; and  

c) at least five minutes have elapsed and the distress alert by DSC has been repeated (see No. *32.21A.1*). (WRC-07)    *32.35* § 22 A ship station in receipt of a shore-to-ship distress alert relay or distress call relay (see No. *32.14*) should establish communication as directed and render such assistance as required and appropriate. (WRC-07)  *32.36 * *D − Preparations for handling of distress traffic*   *32.37* § 23 On receipt of a distress alert or a distress call, ship stations and coast stations shall set watch on the radiotelephone distress and safety traffic frequency associated with the distress and safety calling frequency on which the distress alert was received. (WRC-07)  *32.38* § 24 Coast stations and ship stations with narrow-band direct-printing equipment shall set watch on the narrow-band direct-printing frequency associated with the distress alert if it indicates that narrow-band direct-printing is to be used for subsequent distress communications.

####– Distress traffic

Wordt voorlopig toegepast per 01-01-2013 

*32.39 * *A − General and search and rescue coordinating communications*   *32.40* § 25 Distress traffic consists of all messages relating to the immediate assistance required by the ship in distress, including search and rescue communications and on-scene communications. The distress traffic shall as far as possible be on the frequencies contained in Article 31.  *32.41* (SUP - WRC-07)  *32.42* § 26 For distress traffic by radiotelephony, when establishing communications, calls shall be prefixed by the distress signal MAYDAY.  *32.43* § 27 1) Error correction techniques in accordance with relevant ITU-R Recommendations shall be used for distress traffic by direct-printing telegraphy. All messages shall be preceded by at least one carriage return, a line feed signal, a letter shift signal and the distress signal MAYDAY.  *32.44* 2) Distress communications by direct-printing telegraphy should normally be established by the ship in distress and should be in the broadcast (forward error correction) mode. The ARQ mode may subsequently be used when it is advantageous to do so.  *32.45* § 28 1) The rescue coordination centre responsible for controlling a search and rescue operation shall also coordinate the distress traffic relating to the incident or may appoint another station to do so. (WRC-07)  *32.46* 2) The rescue coordination centre coordinating distress traffic, the unit coordinating search and rescue operations<sup> 120)  * 32.46.1* In accordance with the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (1979) this is the on-scene commander (OSC) or the coordinator surface search (CSS). </sup> or the coast station involved may impose silence on stations which interfere with that traffic. This instruction shall be addressed to all stations or to one station only, according to circumstances. In either case, the following shall be used:  *32.47 * *a)* in radiotelephony, the signal SEELONCE MAYDAY, pronounced as the French expression “silence, m’aider”;  *32.48 * *b)* in narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy normally using forward-error correcting mode, the signal SILENCE MAYDAY. However, the ARQ mode may be used when it is advantageous to do so.  *32.49* § 29 Until they receive the message indicating that normal working may be resumed (see No. *32.51*), all stations which are aware of the distress traffic, and which are not taking part in it, and which are not in distress, are forbidden to transmit on the frequencies in which the distress traffic is taking place.  *32.50* § 30 A station of the mobile service which, while following distress traffic, is able to continue its normal service, may do so when the distress traffic is well established and on condition that it observes the provisions of No. *32.49* and that it does not interfere with distress traffic.  *32.51* § 31 When distress traffic has ceased on frequencies which have been used for distress traffic, the station controlling the search and rescue operation shall initiate a message for transmission on these frequencies indicating that distress traffic has finished. (WRC-07)  *32.52* § 32 1) In radiotelephony, the message referred to in No. *32.51* should consist of the following taking into account Nos. *32.6* and *32.7*: 

– the distress signal “MAYDAY”;  

– the words “ALL STATIONS”, spoken three times;  

– the words “THIS IS”;  

– the name of the station sending that message, spoken three times;  

– the call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;  

– the time of handing in of the message;  

– the MMSI (if the initial alert has been sent by DSC), the name and the call sign of the mobile station which was in distress;  

– the words “SEELONCE FEENEE” pronounced as the French words “silence fini”. (WRC-12)    *32.53* 2) In direct-printing telegraphy, the message referred to in No. *32.51* consists of: 

– the distress signal “MAYDAY”;  

– the characters “CQ”;  

– the characters “DE”;  

– the call sign or other identification of the station sending the message;  

– the time of handing in of the message;  

– the name and call sign of the mobile station which was in distress; and  

– the words “SILENCE FINI”.    *32.53A * *Cancellation of an inadvertent distress alert (WRC-07)*   *32.53B* § 32A 1) A station transmitting an inadvertent distress alert or call shall cancel the transmission. (WRC-07)  *32.53C* 2) An inadvertent DSC alert shall be cancelled by DSC, if the DSC equipment is so capable. The cancellation should be in accordance with the most recent version of Recommendation ITU-R M.493. In all cases, cancellations shall also be transmitted by radiotelephone in accordance with *32.53E*. (WRC-07) *32.53D* 3) An inadvertent distress call shall be cancelled by radiotelephone in accordance with the procedure in *32.53E*. (WRC-07)  *32.53E* 4) Inadvertent distress transmissions shall be cancelled orally on the associated distress and safety frequency in the same band on which the distress transmission was sent, using the following procedure, taking into account Nos. *32.6* and *32.7*: 

– the words “ALL STATIONS”, spoken three times;  

– the words “THIS IS”;  

– the name of the vessel, spoken three times;  

– the call sign or other identification;  

– the MMSI (if the initial alert has been sent by DSC);  

– the words “PLEASE CANCEL MY DISTRESS ALERT OF” followed by the time in UTC.   Monitor the same band on which the inadvertent distress transmission was sent and respond to any communications concerning that distress transmission as appropriate. (WRC-12)  *32.54 * *B − On-scene communications*   *32.55* § 33 1) On-scene communications are those between the mobile unit in distress and assisting mobile units, and between the mobile units and the unit coordinating search and rescue operations<sup> 121)  *9 32.55.1*, *32.56.1* and *32.59.1* In accordance with the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (1979) this is the on-scene commander (OSC) or the coordinator surface search (CSS). </sup>. *32.56* 2) Control of on-scene communications is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations9. Simplex communications shall be used so that all on-scene mobile stations may share relevant information concerning the distress incident. If direct-printing telegraphy is used, it shall be in the forward error-correcting mode.  *32.57* § 34 1) The preferred frequencies in radiotelephony for on-scene communications are 156.8 MHz and 2 182 kHz. The frequency 2 174.5 kHz may also be used for ship-to-ship on-scene communications using narrow-band direct-printing telegraphy in the forward error correcting mode.  *32.58* 2) In addition to 156.8 MHz and 2 182 kHz, the frequencies 3 023 kHz, 4 125 kHz, 5 680 kHz, 123.1 MHz and 156.3 MHz may be used for ship-to-aircraft on-scene communications.  *32.59* § 35 The selection or designation of on-scene frequencies is the responsibility of the unit coordinating search and rescue operations9. Normally, once an on-scene frequency is established, a continuous aural or teleprinter watch is maintained by all participating on-scene mobile units on the selected frequency.  *32.60 * *C − Locating and homing signals*   *32.61* § 36 1) Locating signals are radio transmissions intended to facilitate the finding of a mobile unit in distress or the location of survivors. These signals include those transmitted by searching units, and those transmitted by the mobile unit in distress, by survival craft, by float-free EPIRBs, by satellite EPIRBs and by search and rescue radar transponders to assist the searching units.  *32.62* 2) Homing signals are those locating signals which are transmitted by mobile units in distress, or by survival craft, for the purpose of providing searching units with a signal that can be used to determine the bearing to the transmitting stations. *32.63* 3) Locating signals may be transmitted in the following frequency bands: 117.975-137 MHz; 156-174 MHz; 406-406.1 MHz; and 9 200-9 500 MHz.

###Section III 

####– Medical transports

Wordt voorlopig toegepast per 01-01-2013 

*33.19* § 10 The term “medical transports”, as defined in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols, refers to any means of transportation by land, water or air, whether military or civilian, permanent or temporary, assigned exclusively to medical transportation and under the control of a competent authority of a party to a conflict or of neutral States and of other States not parties to an armed conflict, when these ships, craft and aircraft assist the wounded, the sick and the shipwrecked.  *33.20* § 11 1) For the purpose of announcing and identifying medical transports which are protected under the above-mentioned Conventions, the procedure of Section II of this Article is used. The urgency call shall be followed by the addition of the single word MEDICAL in narrow-band direct-printing and by the addition of the single word MAY-DEE-CAL pronounced as in French “médical”, in radiotelephony. (WRC-07)  *33.20A* 2) When using digital selective calling techniques, the urgency announcement on the appropriate Digital Selective Calling distress and safety frequencies shall always be addressed to all stations on VHF and to a specified geographical area on MF and HF and shall indicate “Medical transport” in accordance with the most recent version of Recommendations ITU-R M.493 and ITU-R M.541. (WRC-07) *33.20B* 3) Medical transports may use one or more of the distress and safety traffic frequencies specified in Section I of Article *31* for the purpose of self-identification and to establish communications. As soon as practicable, communications shall be transferred to an appropriate working frequency. (WRC-07)  *33.21* § 12 The use of the signals described in Nos. *33.20* and *33.20A* indicates that the message which follows concerns a protected medical transport. The message shall convey the following data: (WRC-07)  *33.22* *a)* call sign or other recognized means of identification of the medical transport;  *33.23 * *b)* position of the medical transport;  *33.24 * *c)* number and type of vehicles in the medical transport; *33.25 * *d)* intended route;  *33.26 * *e)* estimated time en route and of departure and arrival, as appropriate;  *33.27 * *f)* any other information, such as flight altitude, radio frequencies guarded, languages used and secondary surveillance radar modes and codes.  *33.28* (SUP - WRC-07)  *33.29* (SUP - WRC-07)  *33.30* § 13 The use of radiocommunications for announcing and identifying medical transports is optional; however, if they are used, the provisions of these Regulations and particularly of this Section and of Articles *30* and *31* shall apply.
###Section IV 

####– Safety communications

Wordt voorlopig toegepast per 01-01-2013 

*33.30A* § 14 The following terms apply: 

a) the safety announcement is a digital selective call using a safety call format in the bands used for terrestrial radiocommunication or a safety message format, in which case it is relayed through space stations;  

b) the safety call is the initial voice or text procedure;  

c) the safety message is the subsequent voice or text procedure. (WRC-07)    *33.31* § 15 1) In a terrestrial system, safety communications consist of a safety announcement, transmitted using digital selective calling, followed by the safety call and message transmitted using radiotelephony, narrow-band direct-printing or data. The announcement of the safety message shall be made on one or more of the distress and safety calling frequencies specified in Section I of Article *31* using either digital selective calling techniques and the safety call format, or radiotelephony procedures and the safety signal. (WRC-07)  *33.31A* 2) However, in order to avoid unnecessary loading of the distress and safety calling frequencies specified for use with digital selective calling techniques: 

a) safety messages transmitted by coast stations in accordance with a predefined timetable should not be announced by digital selective calling techniques;  

b) safety messages which only concern vessels sailing in the vicinity should be announced using radiotelephony procedures. (WRC-07)    *33.31B* 3) In addition, ship stations not equipped for digital selective calling procedures may announce a safety message by transmitting the safety call by radiotelephony. In such cases the announcement shall be made using the frequency 156.8 MHz (VHF channel 16), while taking into account that other stations outside VHF range may not receive the announcement. (WRC-07) *33.31C* 4) In the maritime mobile service, safety messages shall generally be addressed to all stations. In some cases, however, they may be addressed to a particular station. When using digital selective calling techniques, the safety announcement shall indicate which frequency is to be used to send the subsequent message and, in the case of a message to all stations, shall use the “All Ships” format setting. (WRC-07)  *33.32* § 16 1) In the maritime mobile service, the safety message shall, where practicable, be transmitted on a working frequency in the same band(s) as those used for the safety announcement or call. A suitable indication to this effect shall be made at the end of the safety call. In the case that no other option is practicable, the safety message may be sent by radiotelephony on the frequency 156.8 MHz (VHF channel 16). (WRC-07)  *33.32A* 2) In the maritime mobile-satellite service, a separate safety announcement or call does not need to be made before sending the safety message.
