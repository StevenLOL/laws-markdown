####Agreement on co-operation for sustainable development between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Bhutan

The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan; Convinced of the crucial importance of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; Desiring therefore to promote the implementation of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development and Agenda 21 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held from 3 to 14 June 1992 at Rio de Janeiro; Convinced of the necessity to establish a new and equitable global alliance aiming at the creation of new forms of co-operation between States, between key sectors of society and between individuals; Recognizing the right of each country to strive for higher standards of living for its people; Desiring further to give effect to the Declaration of Intent signed by the representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Kingdom of Bhutan in Rio de Janeiro on 11 June 1992; Realizing the complexity of operationalizing sustainable development in view of differing economic development levels, resource endowments, social and political systems and cultures; Recognizing that development can only be sustainable if it is comprehensive in nature, *i.e.* embraces economic, social, cultural, civil and political as well as religious and ecological aspects; Guided by the precautionary principle, by virtue of which lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing efficient measures to prevent or minimize environmental degradation where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage; Considering that States have to co-operate in a spirit of global solidarity to conserve, protect and establish an ecosystem of the Earth, taking into account that they have contributed to a significant extent to the degradation on a global level and have therefore shared but different responsibilities; Desiring to enter upon long-term co-operation between their countries based on equality and reciprocity as well as consultation and mutual assistance in order effectively to bring about sustainable development, promoting the participation of all interest groups in society therein; Considering that to that end an agreement should be concluded which shall create a legal and administrative framework for future action; Have agreed as follows:
