Whereas, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in respect of Curaçao, and the United States of America (each, a “Party,” and together, the “Parties”) have a longstanding and close relationship with respect to mutual assistance in tax matters in respect of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, in respect of Curaçao, and the United States of America and desire to conclude an agreement to improve international tax compliance through mutual assistance in tax matters based on an effective infrastructure for the automatic exchange of information; Whereas, both Parties share the understanding that the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes, done at Washington on 17 April 2002 (the “TIEA”) continues to apply to, inter alia, Curaçao (formerly part of the Netherlands Antilles) subject to the understandings reached in an exchange of notes dated 31 October 2014 and 4 November 2014 between the Parties regarding the application of the TIEA in light of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles; Whereas, Article 4 of the TIEA authorizes the exchange of information for tax purposes, including on an automatic basis; Whereas, the United States of America enacted provisions commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), which introduce a reporting regime for financial institutions with respect to certain accounts; Whereas, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, including Curaçao, is supportive of the underlying policy goal of FATCA to improve tax compliance; Whereas, FATCA has raised a number of issues, including that Curaçao financial institutions may not be able to comply with certain aspects of FATCA due to domestic legal impediments; Whereas, the United States of America collects information regarding certain accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions held by residents of Curaçao and is committed to exchanging such information with Curaçao and pursuing equivalent levels of exchange, provided that appropriate safeguards and infrastructure for an effective exchange relationship are in place; Whereas, an intergovernmental approach to FATCA implementation would address legal impediments and reduce burdens for Curaçao financial institutions; Whereas, the Parties desire to conclude an agreement to improve international tax compliance and provide for the implementation of FATCA with respect to Curaçao based on domestic reporting and reciprocal automatic exchange pursuant to the TIEA and subject to the confidentiality and other protections provided for therein, including the provisions limiting the use of the information exchanged under the TIEA;   Now, therefore, the Parties have agreed as follows:

If a Curaçao Financial Institution, that otherwise meets the requirements described in paragraph 1 of this Article or is described in paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article, has a Related Entity or branch that operates in a jurisdiction that prevents such Related Entity or branch from fulfilling the requirements of a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or has a Related Entity or branch that is treated as a nonparticipating FFI solely due to the expiration of the transitional rule for limited FFIs and limited branches under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations, such Curaçao Financial Institution shall continue to be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and shall continue to be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner, as appropriate, for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, provided that: 

a) the Curaçao Financial Institution treats each such Related Entity or branch as a separate Nonparticipating Financial Institution for purposes of all the reporting and withholding requirements of this Agreement and each such Related Entity or branch identifies itself to withholding agents as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution;  

b) each such Related Entity or branch identifies its U.S. accounts and reports the information with respect to those accounts as required under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to the extent permitted under the relevant laws pertaining to the Related Entity or branch; and  

c) such Related Entity or branch does not specifically solicit U.S. accounts held by persons that are not resident in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located or accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions that are not established in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located, and such Related Entity or branch is not used by the Curaçao Financial Institution or any other Related Entity to circumvent the obligations under this Agreement or under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as appropriate.     
6.   Coordination of Timing. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 3 of this Agreement: 

a) Curaçao shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the calendar year with respect to which similar information is required to be reported to the IRS by participating FFIs pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations;  

b) Curaçao shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which participating FFIs are required to report similar information to the IRS under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations;  

c) the United States shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the first calendar year with respect to which Curaçao is required to obtain and exchange information; and  

d) the United States shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which Curaçao is required to begin exchanging information.     
7.   Coordination of Definitions with U.S. Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding Article 1 of this Agreement and the definitions provided in the Annexes to this Agreement, in implementing this Agreement Curaçao may use, and may permit Curaçao Financial Institutions to use, a definition in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of a corresponding definition in this Agreement, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of this Agreement.

### I  

####General.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

A) Curaçao shall require that Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions apply the due diligence procedures contained in this Annex I to identify U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions.  

B) For purposes of the Agreement, 

1. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars and shall be read to include the equivalent in other currencies.

3. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of June 30, 2014 under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of that day or the last day of the reporting period ending immediately before June 30, 2014, and where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a calendar year under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.

### II  

####Preexisting Individual Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Accounts held by individuals (“Preexisting Individual Accounts”). 

A) Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in Curaçao provide for such an election, the following Preexisting Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts:

3. A Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, provided the law or regulations of Curaçao or the United States effectively prevent the sale of such a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract to U.S. residents (e.g., if the relevant Financial Institution does not have the required registration under U.S. law, and the law of Curaçao requires reporting or withholding with respect to insurance products held by residents of Curaçao).  

4. A Depository Account with a balance of $50,000 or less.    

B) Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value as of June 30, 2014, that Exceeds $50,000 ($250,000 for a Cash Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract), But Does Not Exceed $1,000,000 (“Lower Value Accounts”). 

1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution for any of the following U.S. indicia: 

a) Identification of the Account Holder as a U.S. citizen or resident;

g) An “in-care-of” or “hold mail” address that is the sole address the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution has on file for the Account Holder. In the case of a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account, an “in-care-of” address outside the United States or “hold mail” address shall not be treated as U.S. indicia.    

2. If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account described in paragraph D of this section.  

3. If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

4. Notwithstanding a finding of U.S. indicia under subparagraph B(1) of this section, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is not required to treat an account as a U.S. Reportable Account if: 

a) Where the Account Holder information unambiguously indicates a U.S. place of birth, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form);  

2. A non-U.S. passport or other government-issued identification evidencing the Account Holder’s citizenship or nationality in a country other than the United States; and  

3. A copy of the Account Holder’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States or a reasonable explanation of: 

a) The reason the Account Holder does not have such a certificate despite relinquishing U.S. citizenship; or  

b) The reason the Account Holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth.      

b) Where the Account Holder information contains a current U.S. mailing or residence address, or one or more U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers associated with the account, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.    

c) Where the Account Holder information contains standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.    

d) Where the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address, has an “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address identified for the Account Holder, or has one or more U.S. telephone numbers (if a non-U.S. telephone number is also associated with the account), the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: 

1. A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); or  

2. Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non-U.S. status.        

C) Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Individual Accounts That Are Lower Value Accounts. 

1. Review of Preexisting Individual Accounts that are Lower Value Accounts for U.S. indicia must be completed by June 30, 2016.  

2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless subparagraph B(4) of this section applies.  

3. Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.    

D) Enhanced Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value That Exceeds $1,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, or December 31 of 2015 or Any Subsequent Year (“High Value Accounts”). 

1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section.  

2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution’s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph D(3) of this section, then no further paper record search is required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section: 

a) The most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account;  

b) The most recent account opening contract or documentation;  

c) The most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes;  

d) Any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and  

e) Any standing instructions to transfer funds currently in effect.    

3. Exception Where Databases Contain Sufficient Information. A Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph D(2) of this section if the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution’s electronically searchable information includes the following: 

a) The Account Holder’s nationality or residence status;  

b) The Account Holder’s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution;  

c) The Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution;

e) Whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address for the Account Holder; and  

f) Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account.    

4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat as a U.S. Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with such High Value Account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person.  

5. Effect of Finding U.S. Indicia. 

a) If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a Specified U.S. Person in subparagraph D(4) of this section, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account.  

b) If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

c) Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.      

E) Additional Procedures Applicable to High Value Accounts. 

1. If a Preexisting Individual Account is a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account by June 30, 2015. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account on or before December 31, 2014, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to 2014 in the first report on the account and on an annual basis thereafter. In the case of an account identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after December 31, 2014 and on or before June 30, 2015, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is not required to report information about such account with respect to 2014, but must report information about the account on an annual basis thereafter.  

2. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, but becomes a High Value Account as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person.  

3. Once a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section to a High Value Account, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph D(4) of this section, to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year.  

4. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account.  

5. A Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in the United States, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section, is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder.    

F) Preexisting Individual Accounts That Have Been Documented for Certain Other Purposes. A Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution that has previously obtained documentation from an Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status as neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident in order to meet its obligations under a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its obligations under chapter 61 of Title 26 of the United States Code, is not required to perform the procedures described in subparagraph B(1) of this section with respect to Lower Value Accounts or subparagraphs D(1) through D(3) of this section with respect to High Value Accounts.  
### III  

####New Individual Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Financial Accounts held by individuals and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Individual Accounts”). 

A) Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in Curaçao provide for such an election, the following New Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 

1. A Depository Account unless the account balance exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.  

2. A Cash Value Insurance Contract unless the Cash Value exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period.    

B) Other New Individual Accounts. With respect to New Individual Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, upon account opening (or within 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the account ceases to be described in paragraph A of this section), the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution to determine whether the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes (for this purpose, a U.S. citizen is considered to be resident in the United States for tax purposes, even if the Account Holder is also a tax resident of another jurisdiction) and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. 

1. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account and obtain a self-certification that includes the Account Holder’s U.S. TIN (which may be an IRS Form W-9 or other similar agreed form).  

2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self-certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes whether the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. tax purposes. If the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is unable to obtain a valid self-certification, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.    
### IV  

####Preexisting Entity Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Preexisting Accounts held by Entities (“Preexisting Entity Accounts”). 

A) Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in Curaçao provide for such an election, a Preexisting Entity Account with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a U.S. Reportable Account until the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000.  

B) Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A Preexisting Entity Account that has an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, and a Preexisting Entity Account that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 but the account balance or value of which exceeds $1,000,000 as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section.  

C) Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Specified U.S. Persons, or by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, shall be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. In addition, accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions shall be treated as accounts for which aggregate payments as described in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement are reported to the Curaçao Competent Authority.  

D)  Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Specified U.S. Persons, by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, or by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions: 

1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Specified U.S. Person. 

a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person includes a U.S. place of incorporation or organization, or a U.S. address.  

b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or a similar agreed form), or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Specified U.S. Person.    

2. Determine Whether a Non-U.S. Entity Is a Financial Institution. 

a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution.  

b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution, or the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account.    

3. Determine Whether a Financial Institution Is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution Payments to Which Are Subject to Aggregate Reporting Under Subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. 

a) Subject to subparagraph D(3)(b) of this section, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution, as applicable. In such case, no further review, identification, or reporting is required with respect to the account.  

b) If the Account Holder is a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.  

c) If the Account Holder is not a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution, then the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution payments to which are reportable under subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement, unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution: 

1. Obtains a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or similar agreed form) from the Account Holder that it is a certified deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or  

2. In the case of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list.      

4. Determine Whether an Account Held by an NFFE Is a U.S. Reportable Account. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account that is not identified as either a U.S. Person or a Financial Institution, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must identify (i) whether the Account Holder has Controlling Persons, (ii) whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, and (iii) whether any of the Controlling Persons of the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident. In making these determinations the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs D(4)(a) through D(4)(d) of this section in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. 

a) For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures.  

b) For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE.  

c) For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident for tax purposes, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution may rely on: 

1. Information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that does not exceed $1,000,000; or  

2. A self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that exceeds $1,000,000.    

d) If any Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident, the account shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account.      

E) Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Entity Accounts. 

1. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 must be completed by June 30, 2016.  

2. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, but exceeds $1,000,000 as of December 31 of 2015 or any subsequent year, must be completed within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000.  

3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that causes the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must redetermine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section.

####New Entity Accounts.

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Financial Accounts held by Entities and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Entity Accounts”). 

A) Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in Curaçao provide for such election, a credit card account or a revolving credit facility treated as a New Entity Account is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported, provided that the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution maintaining such account implements policies and procedures to prevent an account balance owed to the Account Holder that exceeds $50,000.  

B) Other New Entity Accounts. With respect to New Entity Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is: (i) a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (iv) an Active NFFE or Passive NFFE. 

1. Subject to subparagraph B(2) of this section, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE, a Curaçao Financial Institution, or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution, as applicable.  

2. If the Account Holder is a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.  

3. In all other cases, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status. Based on the self-certification, the following rules apply: 

a) If the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.  

b) If the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must identify the Controlling Persons as determined under AML/KYC Procedures, and must determine whether any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident on the basis of a self-certification from the Account Holder or such person. If any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account.  

c) If the Account Holder is: (i) a U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) subject to subparagraph B(3)(d) of this section, a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; (iv) an Active NFFE; or (v) a Passive NFFE none of the Controlling Persons of which is a U.S. citizen or resident, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, and no reporting is required with respect to the account.  

d) If the Account Holder is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution (including a Curaçao Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution), then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement.

e) Substantially all of the activities of the NFFE consist of holding (in whole or in part) the outstanding stock of, or providing financing and services to, one or more subsidiaries that engage in trades or businesses other than the business of a Financial Institution, except that an entity shall not qualify for NFFE status if the entity functions (or holds itself out) as an investment fund, such as a private equity fund, venture capital fund, leveraged buyout fund, or any investment vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes;  

f) The NFFE is not yet operating a business and has no prior operating history, but is investing capital into assets with the intent to operate a business other than that of a Financial Institution, provided that the NFFE shall not qualify for this exception after the date that is 24 months after the date of the initial organization of the NFFE;

(v) The applicable laws of the NFFE’s jurisdiction of residence or the NFFE’s formation documents require that, upon the NFFE’s liquidation or dissolution, all of its assets be distributed to a governmental entity or other non-profit organization, or escheat to the government of the NFFE’s jurisdiction of residence or any political subdivision thereof.      

5. Preexisting Account. A “Preexisting Account” means a Financial Account maintained by a Reporting Financial Institution as of June 30, 2014.    

C) Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Translation Rules. 

1. Aggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this paragraph 1.  

2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated.  

3. Special Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts.  

4. Currency Translation Rule. For purposes of determining the balance or value of Financial Accounts denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must convert the U.S. dollar threshold amounts described in this Annex I into such currency using a published spot rate determined as of the last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution is determining the balance or value.    

D)  Documentary Evidence. For purposes of this Annex I, acceptable documentary evidence includes any of the following: 

1. A certificate of residence issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) of the jurisdiction in which the payee claims to be a resident.  

2. With respect to an individual, any valid identification issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality), that includes the individual’s name and is typically used for identification purposes.  

3. With respect to an Entity, any official documentation issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) that includes the name of the Entity and either the address of its principal office in the jurisdiction (or U.S. Territory) in which it claims to be a resident or the jurisdiction (or U.S. Territory) in which the Entity was incorporated or organized.  

4. With respect to a Financial Account maintained in a jurisdiction with anti-money laundering rules that have been approved by the IRS in connection with a QI agreement (as described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations), any of the documents, other than a Form W-8 or W-9, referenced in the jurisdiction’s attachment to the QI agreement for identifying individuals or Entities.  

5. Any financial statement, third-party credit report, bankruptcy filing, or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission report.    

E) Alternative Procedures for Financial Accounts Held by Individual Beneficiaries of a Cash Value Insurance Contract. A Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash Value Insurance Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Specified U.S. Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a U.S. Reportable Account unless the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Specified U.S. Person. A Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a Cash Value Insurance Contract is a Specified U.S. Person if the information collected by the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution and associated with the beneficiary contains U.S. indicia as described in subparagraph (B)(1) of section II of this Annex I. If a Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Specified U.S. Person, the Reporting Curaçao Financial Institution must follow the procedures in subparagraph B(3) of section II of this Annex I.  

F) Reliance on Third Parties. Regardless of whether an election is made under paragraph C of section I of this Annex I, Curaçao may permit Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions to rely on due diligence procedures performed by third parties, to the extent provided in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations.  

G) Alternative Procedures for New Accounts Opened Prior to Entry Into Force of this Agreement. 

1. Applicability. If the Kingdom of the Netherlands has provided a written notice to the United States prior to entry into force of this Agreement that, as of July 1, 2014, Curaçao lacked the legal authority to require Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions either: (i) to require Account Holders of New Individual Accounts to provide the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I, or (ii) to perform all the due diligence procedures related to New Entity Accounts specified in section V of this Annex I, then Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions may apply the alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section, as applicable, to such New Accounts, in lieu of the procedures otherwise required under this Annex I. The alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section shall be available only for those New Individual Accounts or New Entity Accounts, as applicable, opened prior to the earlier of: (i) the date Curaçao has the ability to compel Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions to comply with the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, which date the Kingdom of the Netherlands shall inform the United States of in writing by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or (ii) the date of entry into force of this Agreement. If the alternative procedures for New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, described in paragraph H of this section are applied with respect to all New Entity Accounts or a clearly identified group of such accounts, the alternative procedures described in this paragraph G may not be applied with respect to such New Entity Accounts. For all other New Accounts, Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions must apply the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, to determine if the account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution.  

2. Alternative Procedures. 

a) Within one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to a New Individual Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, request the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification consistent with the procedures described in section III of this Annex I, and (ii) with respect to a New Entity Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I and request information as necessary to document the account, including any self-certification, required by section V of this Annex I.  

b) Curaçao must report on any New Account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported with respect to such a New Account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the New Account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened.  

c) By the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions must close any New Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section for which it was unable to collect the required self-certification or other documentation pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section. In addition, by the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Individual Accounts (without regard to whether such accounts were High Value Accounts), perform the due diligence procedures specified in paragraph D of section II of this Annex I, or (ii) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Entity Accounts, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section IV of this Annex I.  

d) Curaçao must report on any closed account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(c) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported for such a closed account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened.      

H) Alternative Procedures for New Entity Accounts Opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015. For New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, Curaçao may permit Reporting Curaçao Financial Institutions to treat such accounts as Preexisting Entity Accounts and apply the due diligence procedures related to Preexisting Entity Accounts specified in section IV of this Annex I in lieu of the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I. In this case, the due diligence procedures of section IV of this Annex I must be applied without regard to the account balance or value threshold specified in paragraph A of section IV of this Annex I.  

### Annex  II  
Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

The following Entities shall be treated as exempt beneficial owners or deemed-compliant FFIs, as the case may be, and the following accounts are excluded from the definition of Financial Accounts.

This Annex II may be modified by a mutual written decision entered into between the Competent Authorities of Curaçao and the United States: (1) to include additional Entities, accounts and products that present a low risk of being used by U.S. Persons to evade U.S. tax and that have similar characteristics to the Entities, accounts, and products described in this Annex II as of the date of signature of the Agreement; or (2) to remove Entities, accounts and products that, due to changes in circumstances, no longer present a low risk of being used by U.S. Persons to evade U.S. tax. Any such addition or removal shall be effective on the date of signature of the mutual decision, unless otherwise provided therein. Procedures for reaching such a mutual decision may be included in the mutual agreement or arrangement described in paragraph 6 of Article 3 of the Agreement.
