### Article  7  

####Business profits

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.   
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.   
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the business of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. However, no such deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts, if any, paid (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission, for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise, by way of interest on moneys lent to the permanent establishment. Likewise, no account shall be taken, in the determination of the profits of a permanent establishment, for amounts charged (otherwise than towards reimbursement of actual expenses), by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights, or by way of commission for specific services performed or for management, or, except in the case of a banking enterprise by way of interest on moneys lent to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices.   
4.  Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary. The method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article.   
5.  No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise.   
6.  For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary.   
7.  Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article.  

### Article  8

####Associated enterprises

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip

a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or  

b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.     
2.  Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits where that other State considers the adjustment justified. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other.

The competent authorities of the Contracting States may settle the mode of application of these limitations by mutual agreement.

The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.   
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
5.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State.   
6.  No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the shares or other rights in respect of which the dividend is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this limitation.

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.   
6.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   
7.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.   
8.  No relief shall be available under this Article if it was the main purpose or one of the main purposes of any person concerned with the creation or assignment of the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid to take advantage of this Article by means of that creation or assignment.

In such case, the provisions of Article 7 shall apply.

Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether that person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated.   
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person’s capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised.   
3.  Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from activities exercised in the other Contracting State as envisaged in paragraphs 1 and 2, shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if the visit to that other State is supported wholly or mainly by public funds of the first-mentioned Contracting State, a political subdivision or a local authority thereof, or takes place under a cultural agreement or arrangement between the Governments of the Contracting States.

The transfer of a pension, other similar remuneration or annuity from a pension fund or an insurance company in a Contracting State to a pension fund or insurance company in another State shall not restrict in any way the taxing rights of the first-mentioned State under this Article.

### CHAPTER  IV  

####ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

### Article  22  

####Elimination of double taxation

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Zambia shall eliminate double taxation as follows: where a resident of Zambia derives income from the Netherlands which may be taxed in the Netherlands in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, the amount of the Netherlands tax payable in respect of that income shall be allowed as a credit against Zambian tax imposed on that resident. The amount of credit, however, shall not exceed that part of Zambian tax which is appropriate to that income.   
2.  The Netherlands may include in the basis upon which taxes are imposed on its residents, the items of income which according to the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed or shall be taxable only in Zambia.   
3.  However, where a resident of the Netherlands derives items of income which according to paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 of Article 6, paragraph 1 of Article 7, paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13, paragraph 1 of Article 14, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 17, paragraph 1 (subparagraph a) of Article 18 and paragraph 2 of Article 21 of this Convention may be taxed or shall be taxable only in Zambia and are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 2, the Netherlands shall exempt such items of income by allowing a reduction of its tax. This reduction shall be computed in conformity with the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. For that purpose the said items of income shall be deemed to be included in the amount of the items of income which are exempt from Netherlands tax under those provisions.   
4.  Further, the Netherlands shall allow a reduction from the Netherlands tax so computed for the items of income which according to paragraph 2 of Article 10, paragraph 2 of Article 11, paragraph 2 of Article 12, paragraph 1 of Article 15, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 16, paragraph 4 of Article 17, paragraph 3 of Article 21 of this Convention and paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article VI of the Protocol to this Convention may be taxed in Zambia to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 2. The amount of this reduction shall be equal to the tax paid in Zambia on these items of income, but shall, in case the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation provide so, not exceed the amount of the reduction which would be allowed if the items of income so included were the sole items for which the Netherlands gives a reduction under the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation. This paragraph shall not restrict allowance now or hereafter accorded by the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation, but only as far as the calculation of the amount of the reduction of Netherlands tax is concerned with respect to the aggregation of income from more than one country and the carry forward of the tax paid in Zambia on the said items of income to subsequent years.   
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, the Netherlands shall allow a reduction from the Netherlands tax for the tax paid in Zambia on items of income which according to paragraph 1 of Article 7, paragraph 4 of Article 10, paragraph 5 of Article 11, paragraph 4 of Article 12 and paragraph 2 of Article 21 of this Convention may be taxed in Zambia to the extent that these items are included in the basis referred to in paragraph 2, insofar as the Netherlands under the provisions of the Netherlands law for the avoidance of double taxation allows a reduction from the Netherlands tax of the tax levied in another country on such items of income. For the computation of this reduction the provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall apply accordingly.  

### CHAPTER  V  

####SPECIAL PROVISIONS

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

### Article  23  

####Non-discrimination

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.   
2.  Residents of a Contracting State who are not nationals of any State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of the first-mentioned Contracting State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.   
3.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents.   
4.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 7 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.   
5.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.   
6.  Contributions paid by, or on behalf of, an individual who exercises employment or self-employment in a Contracting State to a pension fund that is recognised for tax purposes in the other Contracting State shall be treated in the same way for tax purposes in the first-mentioned State as a contribution paid to a pension fund that is recognised for tax purposes in that first-mentioned State, provided that 

a) such individual was contributing to such pension fund before he became a resident of the first-mentioned State; and  

b) the competent authority of the first-mentioned State considers that such pension fund generally corresponds to a pension fund recognised for tax purposes by that State.   For the purpose of this paragraph, “pension fund” includes a pension plan created under the social security legislation of a Contracting State.   
7.  The provisions of this Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description.  

### Article  24  

####Mutual agreement procedure

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.   
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with this Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.   
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of this Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in this Convention.   
4.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. The competent authorities, through consultations, may develop appropriate bilateral procedures, conditions, methods and techniques for the mutual agreement procedures provided for in this Article.   
5.  Where, 

a) under paragraph 1, a person has presented a case to the competent authority of a Contracting State on the basis that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States have resulted for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention; and  

b) the competent authorities are unable to reach an agreement to resolve that case pursuant to paragraph 2 within two years from the presentation of the case to the competent authority of the other Contracting State; any unresolved issue arising from the case shall be submitted to arbitration at the request of either competent authority. These unresolved issues shall not, however, be submitted to arbitration if: 

(i) a matter has been commenced in a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction and has not been withdrawn; or  

(ii) a decision on the unresolved issues has already been rendered by such court or administrative tribunal of either State. Unless a person directly affected by the case does not accept the mutual agreement that implements the arbitration decision, that decision shall be binding on both Contracting States and shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic laws of these States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this paragraph.      

### Article  25  

####Exchange of information

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.   
2.  Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.   
3.  The Contracting States may release to the arbitrator or arbitrators, appointed under the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 24, such information as is necessary for carrying out the arbitration procedure. Such arbitrator or arbitrators shall be subject to the limitations on disclosure described in paragraph 2 of this Article with respect to any information so released.   
4.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;  

c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy.     
5.  If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 4 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.   
6.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 4 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.  

### Article  26  

####Assistance in the collection of taxes

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1.  The Contracting States shall lend assistance to each other in the collection of revenue claims. This assistance is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.   
2.  The term “revenue claim” as used in this Article means an amount owed in respect of taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to this Convention or any other instrument to which the Contracting States are parties, as well as interest, administrative penalties and costs of collection or conservancy related to such amount.   
3.  When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of collection by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That revenue claim shall be collected by that other State in accordance with the provisions of its laws applicable to the enforcement and collection of its own taxes as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State.   
4.  When a revenue claim of a Contracting State is a claim in respect of which that State may, under its law, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection, that revenue claim shall, at the request of the competent authority of that State, be accepted for purposes of taking measures of conservancy by the competent authority of the other Contracting State. That other State shall take measures of conservancy in respect of that revenue claim in accordance with the provisions of its laws as if the revenue claim were a revenue claim of that other State even if, at the time when such measures are applied, the revenue claim is not enforceable in the first-mentioned State or is owed by a person who has a right to prevent its collection.   
5.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, be subject to the time limits or accorded any priority applicable to a revenue claim under the laws of that State by reason of its nature as such. In addition, a revenue claim accepted by a Contracting State for the purposes of paragraph 3 or 4 shall not, in that State, have any priority applicable to that revenue claim under the laws of the other Contracting State.   
6.  Proceedings with respect to the existence, validity or the amount of a revenue claim of a Contracting State shall not be brought before the courts or administrative bodies of the other Contracting State.   
7.  Where, at any time after a request has been made by a Contracting State under paragraph 3 or 4 and before the other Contracting State has collected and remitted the relevant revenue claim to the first-mentioned State, the relevant revenue claim ceases to be 

a) in the case of a request under paragraph 3, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State that is enforceable under the laws of that State and is owed by a person who, at that time, cannot, under the laws of that State, prevent its collection; or  

b) in the case of a request under paragraph 4, a revenue claim of the first-mentioned State in respect of which that State may, under its laws, take measures of conservancy with a view to ensure its collection;   the competent authority of the first-mentioned State shall promptly notify the competent authority of the other State of that fact and, at the option of the other State, the first-mentioned State shall either suspend or withdraw its request.   
8.  In no case shall the provisions of this Article be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: 

a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;  

b) to carry out measures which would be contrary to public policy;  

c) to provide assistance if the other Contracting State has not pursued all reasonable measures of collection or conservancy, as the case may be, available under its laws or administrative practice;  

d) to provide assistance in those cases where the administrative burden for that State is clearly disproportionate to the benefit to be derived by the other Contracting State.

3.  The Convention shall not apply to international organisations, organs and officials thereof and members of a diplomatic mission or consular post of a third State, being present in a Contracting State, if they are not subjected therein to the same obligations in respect of taxes on income as are residents of that State.

1. It is understood that the fact that associated enterprises have concluded arrangements, such as cost sharing arrangements or general services agreements, for or based on the allocation of executive, general administrative, technical and commercial expenses, research and development expenses and other similar expenses, is not in itself a condition as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9. However, this does not prevent a Contracting State from checking the above-mentioned arrangements or agreements for conditions as meant in paragraph 1 of Article 9.  

2. Where paragraph 2 of Article 9 requires a Contracting State to make an appropriate adjustment to reflect a change made by the other Contracting State falling within paragraph 1 of Article 9, the State making the appropriate adjustment shall not be required to take into account any penalty, whether tax or non-tax, imposed by the other Contracting State.

3. Where an individual has been a resident of a Contracting State and has become a resident of the other Contracting State, the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 13 shall not prevent the first-mentioned State from taxing under its domestic law the capital appreciation of shares, profit sharing certificates, call options and usufruct on shares and profit sharing certificates, in and debt-claims on a company for the period of residency of that individual in the first-mentioned State. In such case, the appreciation of capital taxed in the first-mentioned State shall not be included in the tax base when determining the appreciation of capital by the other State.
