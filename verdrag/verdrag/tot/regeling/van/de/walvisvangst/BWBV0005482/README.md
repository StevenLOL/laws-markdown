####INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE REGULATION OF WHALING

*Washington, 2nd December, 1946*  The Governments whose duly authorized representatives have subscribed hereto, Recognizing the interest of the nations of the world in safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by the whale stocks; Considering that the history of whaling has seen over-fishing of one area after another and of one species of whale after another to such a degree that it is essential to protect all species of whales from further over-fishing; Recognizing that the whale stocks are susceptible of natural increases if whaling is properly regulated, and that increases in the size of whale stocks will permit increases in the numbers of whales which may be captured without endangering these natural resources; Recognizing that it is in the common interest to achieve the optimum level of whale stocks as rapidly as possible without causing wide-spread economic and nutritional distress; Recognizing that in the course of achieving these objectives, whaling operations should be confined to those species best able to sustain exploitation in order to give an interval for recovery to certain species of whales now depleted in numbers; Desiring to establish a system of international regulation for the whale fisheries to ensure proper and effective conservation and development of whale stocks on the basis of the principles embodied in the provisions of the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in London on 8th June, 1937, and the protocols to that Agreement signed in London on 24th June, 1938 and 26th November, 1945; and Having decided to conclude a convention to provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry;   Have agreed as follows:—

###Factory Ship Operations

2. 
a) It is forbidden to use a factory ship or whale catcher attached thereto for the purpose of taking or treating baleen whales except minke whales, in any waters south of 40° South Latitude except during the period from 12th December to 7th April following, both days inclusive.  

b) It is forbidden to use a factory ship or whale catcher attached thereto for the purpose of taking or treating sperm or minke whales, except as permitted by the Contracting Governments in accordance with sub-paragraphs c and d of this paragraph, and paragraph 5.  

c) Each Contracting Government shall declare for all factory ships and whale catchers attached thereto under its jurisdiction, an open season or seasons not to exceed eight months out of any period of twelve months during which the taking or killing of sperm whales by whale catchers may be permitted; provided that a separate open season may be declared for each factory ship and the whale catchers attached thereto.  

d) Each Contracting Government shall declare for all factory ships and whale catchers attached thereto under its jurisdiction one continuous open season not to exceed six months out of any period of twelve months during which the taking or killing of minke whales by the whale catchers may be permitted provided that: 

1) a separate open season may be declared for each factory ship and the whale catchers attached thereto;  

2) the open season need not necessarily include the whole or any part of the period declared for other baleen whales pursuant to sub-paragraph a) of this paragraph.      

3. It is forbidden to use a factory ship which has been used during a season in any waters south of 40° South Latitude for the purpose of treating baleen whales, except minke whales, in any other area except the North Pacific Ocean and its dependent waters north of the Equator for the same purpose within a period of one year from the termination of that season; provided that catch limits in the North Pacific Ocean and dependent waters are established as provided in paragraphs 12 and 16 of this Schedule and provided that this paragraph shall not apply to a ship which has been used during the season solely for freezing or salting the meat and entrails of whales intended for human food or feeding animals.   
###Land Station Operations

4. 

a) It is forbidden to use a whale catcher attached to a land station for the purpose of killing or attempting to kill baleen and sperm whales except as permitted by the Contracting Government in accordance with sub-paragraphs b), c) and d) of this paragraph.  

b) Each Contracting Government shall declare for all land stations under its jurisdiction, and whale catchers attached to such land stations, one open season during which the taking or killing of baleen whales, except minke whales, by the whale catchers shall be permitted. Such open season shall be for a period of not more than six consecutive months in any period of twelve months and shall apply to all land stations under the jurisdiction of the Contracting Government: provided that a separate open season may be declared for any land station used for the taking or treating of baleen whales, except minke whales, which is more than 1,000 miles from the nearest land station used for the taking or treating of baleen whales, except minke whales, under the jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government.  

c) Each Contracting Government shall declare for all land stations under its jurisdiction and for whale catchers attached to such land stations, one open season not to exceed eight continuous months in any one period of twelve months, during which the taking or killing of sperm whales by the whale catchers shall be permitted, provided that a separate open season may be declared for any land station used for the taking or treating of sperm whales which is more than 1,000 miles from the nearest land station used for the taking or treating of sperm whales under the jurisdiction of the same Contracting Government.

e) The prohibitions contained in this paragraph shall apply to all land stations as defined in Article II of the Whaling Convention of 1946.     
###Other Operations

5. Each Contracting Government shall declare for all whale catchers under its jurisdiction not operating in conjunction with a factory ship or land station one continuous open season not to exceed six months out of any period of twelve months during which the taking or killing of minke whales by such whale catchers may be permitted. Notwithstanding this paragraph one continuous open season not to exceed nine months may be implemented so far as Greenland is concerned.   
###III. CAPTURE

6. The killing for commercial purposes of whales, except minke whales using the cold grenade harpoon shall be forbidden from the beginning of the 1980/81 pelagic and 1981 coastal seasons. The killing for commercial purposes of minke whales using the cold grenade harpoon shall be forbidden from the beginning of the 1982/83 pelagic and the 1983 coastal seasons. <sup> 1)  The Governments of Brazil, Iceland, Japan, Norway and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics lodged objections to the second sentence of paragraph 6 within the prescribed period. For all other Contracting Governments this sentence came into force on 8 March 1982. Norway withdrew its objection on 9 July 1985 and Brazil on 8 January 1992.Iceland withdrew from the Convention with effect from 30 June 1992. The objections of Japan and the Russian Federation not having been withdrawn, this sentence is not binding upon these governments.  </sup>  

7. 

a) In accordance with Article V(1)(c) of the Convention, commercial whaling, whether by pelagic operations or from land stations, is prohibited in a region designated as the Indian Ocean Sanctuary. This comprises the waters of the Northern Hemisphere from the coast of Africa to 100°E, including the Red and Arabian Seas and the Gulf of Oman; and the waters of the Southern Hemisphere in the sector from 20°E to 130°E, with the Southern boundary set at 55°S. This prohibition applies irrespective of such catch limits for baleen or toothed whales as may from time to time be determined by the Commission. This prohibition shall be reviewed by the Commission at its Annual Meeting in 2002.  

b) In accordance with Article V(1)(c) of the Convention, commercial whaling, whether by pelagic operations or from land stations, is prohibited in a region designated as the Southern Ocean Sanctuary. This Sanctuary comprises the waters of the Southern Hemisphere southwards of the following line: starting from 40 degrees S, 50 degrees W; thence due east to 20 degrees E; thence due south to 55 degrees S; thence due east to 130 degrees E; thence due north to 40 degrees S; thence due east to 130 degrees W; thence due south to 60 degrees S; thence due east to 50 degrees W; thence due north to the point of beginning. This prohibition applies irrespective of the conservation status of baleen and toothed whale stocks in this Sanctuary, as may from time to time be determined by the Commission. However, this prohibition shall be reviewed ten years after its initial adoption and at succeeding ten year intervals, and could be revised at such times by the Commission. Nothing in this sub-paragraph is intended to prejudice the special legal and political status of Antarctica. <sup> 2)  The Government of Japan lodged an objection within the prescribed period to paragraph 7(b) to the extent that it applies to the Antarctic minke whale stocks. The Government of the Russian Federation also lodged an objection to paragraph 7b) within the prescribed period but withdrew it on 26 October 1994.   For all Contracting Governments except Japan paragraph 7b) came into force on 6 December 1994.  </sup>     
###Area Limits for Factory Ships

###Classification of Stocks

10. All stocks of whales shall be classified in one of three categories according to the advice of the Scientific Committee as follows: 

a) A Sustained Management Stock (SMS) is a stock which is not more than 10 per cent of Maximum Sustainable Yield (hereinafter referred to as MSY) stock level below MSY stock level, and not more than 20 per cent above that level; MSY being determined on the basis of the number of whales. When a stock has remained at a stable level for a considerable period under a regime of approximately constant catches, it shall be classified as a Sustained Management Stock in the absence of any positive evidence that it should be otherwise classified. Commercial whaling shall be permitted on Sustained Management Stocks according to the advice of the Scientific Committee. These stocks are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of this Schedule. For stocks at or above the MSY stock level, the permitted catch shall not exceed 90 per cent of the MSY. For stocks between the MSY stock level and 10 per cent below that level, the permitted catch shall not exceed the number of whales obtained by taking 90 per cent of the MSY and reducing that number by 10 per cent for every 1 per cent by which the stock falls short of the MSY stock level.  

b) An Initial Management Stock (IMS) is a stock more than 20 per cent of MSY stock level above MSY stock level. Commercial whaling shall be permitted on Initial Management Stocks according to the advice of the Scientific Committee as to measures necessary to bring the stocks to the MSY stock level and then optimum level in an efficient manner and without risk of reducing them below this level. The permitted catch for such stocks will not be more than 90 per cent of MSY as far as this is known, or, where it will be more appropriate, catching effort shall be limited to that which will take 90 per cent of MSY in a stock at MSY stock level. In the absence of any positive evidence that a continuing higher percentage will not reduce the stock below the MSY stock level no more than 5 per cent of the estimated initial exploitable stock shall be taken in any one year. Exploitation should not commence until an estimate of stock size has been obtained which is satisfactory in the view of the Scientific Committee. Stocks classified as Initial Management Stock are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of this Schedule.  

c) A Protection Stock (PS) is a stock which is below 10 per cent of MSY stock level below MSY stock level. There shall be no commercial whaling on Protection Stocks. Stocks so classified are listed in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of this Schedule.  

d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph 10 there shall be a moratorium on the taking, killing or treating of whales, except minke whales, by factory ships or whale catchers attached to factory ships. This moratorium applies to sperm whales, killer whales and baleen whales, except minke whales.  

e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of paragraph 10, catch limits for the killing for commercial purposes of whales from all stocks for the 1986 coastal and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons and thereafter shall be zero. This provision will be kept under review, based upon the best scientific advice, and by 1990 at the latest the Commission will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effects of this decision on whale stocks and consider modification of this provision and the establishment of other catch limits. <sup> 3)  The Governments of Japan, Norway, Peru and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics lodged objection to paragraph 10(e) within the prescribed period. For all other Contracting Governments this paragraph came into force on 3 February 1983. Peru withdrew its objection on 22 July 1983.   The Government of Japan withdrew its objections with effect from 1 May 1987 with respect to commercial pelagic whaling; from 1 October 1987 with respect to commercial coastal whaling for minke and Bryde’s whales; and from 1 April 1988 with respect to commercial coastal sperm whaling. The objections of Norway and the Russian Federation not having been withdrawn, the paragraph is not binding upon these Governments.  </sup>     
###Baleen Whale Catch Limits

11. The number of baleen whales taken in the Southern Hemisphere in the 2007/2008 pelagic season and the 2008 coastal season shall not exceed the limits shown in Tables 1 and 2.  

12. The number of baleen whales taken in the North Pacific Ocean and dependent waters in 2008 and in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2008 shall not exceed the limits shown in Tables 1 and 2.  

13. 

a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 10, catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling to satisfy aboriginal subsistence need for the 1984 whaling season and each whaling season thereafter shall be established in accordance with the following principles: 

1) For stocks at or above MSY level, aboriginal subsistence catches shall be permitted so long as total removals do not exceed 90 per cent of MSY.  

2) For stocks below the MSY level but above a certain minimum level, aboriginal subsistence catches shall be permitted so long as they are set at levels which will allow whale stocks to move to the MSY level. <sup> 4)  The Commission, on advice of the Scientific Committee, shall establish as far as possible a) a minimum stock level for each stock below which whales shall not be taken, and b) a rate of increase towards the MSY level for each stock. The Scientific Committee shall advise on a minimum stock level and on a range of rates of increase towards the MSY level under different catch regimes.  </sup>  

3) The above provisions will be kept under review, based upon the best scientific advice, and by 1990 at the latest the Commission will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the effects of these provisions on whale stocks and consider modification.  

4) For aboriginal whaling conducted under subparagraphs b)1), b)2), and b)3) of this paragraph, it is forbidden to strike, take or kill calves or any whale accompanied by a calf. For aboriginal whaling conducted under subparagraphs b)4) of this paragraph, it is forbidden to strike, take or kill suckling calves or female whales accompanied by calves.  

5) All aboriginal whaling shall be conducted under national legislation that accords with this paragraph.    

b) Catch limits for aboriginal subsistence whaling are as follows: 

1) The taking of bowhead whales from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock by aborigines is permitted, but only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines and further provided that: 

(i) For the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the number of bowhead whales landed shall not exceed 280. For each of these years the number of bowhead whales struck shall not exceed 67, except that any unused portion of a strike quota from any year (including 15 unused strikes from the 2003-2007 quota) shall be carried forward and added to the strike quotas of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 15 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year.  

(ii) This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.    

2) The taking of gray whales from the Eastern stock in the North Pacific is permitted, but only by aborigines or a Contracting Government on behalf of aborigines, and then only when the meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption by the aborigines. 

(i) For the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the number of gray whales taken in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 620, provided that the number of gray whales taken in any one of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 shall not exceed 140.  

(ii) This provision shall be reviewed annually by the Commission in light of the advice of the Scientific Committee.    

3) The taking by aborigines of minke whales from the West Greenland and Central stocks and fin whales from the West Greenland stock and bowhead whales from the West Greenland feeding aggregation is permitted and then only when the meat and products are to be used exclusively for local consumption. 

(i) The number of fin whales struck from the West Greenland stock in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 19 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.  

(ii) The number of minke whales struck from the Central stock in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 12 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 3 shall be added to the quota for any one year.  

(iii) The number of minke whales struck from the West Greenland stock shall not exceed 200 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the strike quota of any of the subsequent years, provided that no more than 15 strikes shall be added to the strike quota for any one year. This provision will be reviewed annually by the Commission, according to the findings and recommendations by the Scientific Committee, which shall be binding.  

(iv) The number of bowhead whales struck off West Greenland in accordance with this sub-paragraph shall not exceed 2 in each of the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, except that any unused portion of the quota for each year shall be carried forward from that year and added to the quota of any subsequent years, provided that no more than 2 shall be added to the quota for any one year. Furthermore, the quota for each year shall only become operative when the Commission has received advice from the Scientific Committee that the strikes are unlikely to endanger the stock.    

4) For the seasons 2008-2012 the number of humpback whales to be taken by the Bequians of St. Vincent and The Grenadines shall not exceed 20. The meat and products of such whales are to be used exclusively for local consumption in St. Vincent and The Grenadines.      

14. It is forbidden to take or kill suckling calves or female whales accompanied by calves.   
###Baleen Whale Size Limits

15. 

a) It is forbidden to take or kill any sei or Bryde’s whales below 40 feet (12.2 metres) in length except that sei and Bryde’s whales of not less than 35 feet (10.7 metres) may be taken for delivery to land stations, provided that the meat of such whales is to be used for local consumption as human or animal food.  

b) It is forbidden to take or kill any fin whales below 57 feet (17.4 metres) in length in the Southern Hemisphere, and it is forbidden to take or kill fin whales below 55 feet (16.8 metres) in the Northern Hemisphere; except that fin whales of not less than 55 feet (16.8 metres) may be taken in the Southern Hemisphere for delivery to land stations and fin whales of not less than 50 feet (15.2 metres) may be taken in the Northern Hemisphere for delivery to land stations, provided that, in each case the meat of such whales is to be used for local consumption as human or animal food.     
###Sperm Whale Catch Limits

16. Catch limits for sperm whales of both sexes shall be set at zero in the Southern Hemisphere for the 1981/82 pelagic season and 1982 coastal seasons and following seasons, and at zero in the Northern Hemisphere for the 1982 and following coastal seasons; except that the catch limits for the 1982 coastal season and following seasons in the Western Division of the North Pacific shall remain undetermined and subject to decision by the Commission following special or annual meetings of the Scientific Committee. These limits shall remain in force until such time as the Commission, on the basis of the scientific information which will be reviewed annually, decides otherwise in accordance with the procedures followed at that time by the Commission.  

17. It is forbidden to take or kill suckling calves or female whales accompanied by calves.   
###Sperm Whale Size Limits

18. 

a) It is forbidden to take or kill any sperm whales below 30 feet (9.2 metres) in length except in the North Atlantic Ocean where it is forbidden to take or kill any sperm whales below 35 feet (10.7 metres).

c) It is forbidden to take or kill any sperm whale over 45 feet (13.7 metres) in length in the North Pacific Ocean and dependent water south of 40° North Latitude during the months of March to June inclusive.     
###IV. TREATMENT

19. 

a) It is forbidden to use a factory ship or a land station for the purpose of treating any whales which are classified as Protection Stocks in paragraph 10 or are taken in contravention of paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16 and 17 of this Schedule, whether or not taken by whale catchers under the jurisdiction of a Contracting Government.  

b) All other whales taken, except minke whales, shall be delivered to the factory ship or land station and all parts of such whales shall be processed by boiling or otherwise, except the internal organs, whale bone and flippers of all whales, the meat of sperm whales and parts of whales intended for human food or feeding animals. A Contracting Government may in less developed regions exceptionally permit treating of whales without use of land stations, provided that such whales are fully utilised in accordance with this paragraph.  

c) Complete treatment of the carcases of “dauhval” and of whales used as fenders will not be required in cases where the meat or bone of such whales is in bad condition.    

20. 

a) The taking of whales for treatment by a factory ship shall be so regulated or restricted by the master or person in charge of the factory ship that no whale carcase (except of a whale used as a fender, which shall be processed as soon as is reasonably practicable) shall remain in the sea for a longer period than thirty-three hours from the time of killing to the time when it is hauled up for treatment.  

b) Whales taken by all whale catchers, whether for factory ships or land stations, shall be clearly marked so as to identify the catcher and to indicate the order of catching.     
###V. SUPERVISION AND CONTROL

21. 

a) There shall be maintained on each factory ship at least two inspectors of whaling for the purpose of maintaining twenty-four hour inspection provided that at least one such inspector shall be maintained on each catcher functioning as a factory ship. These inspectors shall be appointed and paid by the Government having jurisdiction over the factory ship; provided that inspectors need not be appointed to ships which, apart from the storage of products, are used during the season solely for freezing or salting the meat and entrails of whales intended for human food or feeding animals.  

b) Adequate inspection shall be maintained at each land station. The inspectors serving at each land station shall be appointed and paid by the Government having jurisdiction over the land station.  

c) There shall be received such observers as the member countries may arrange to place on factory ships and land stations or groups of land stations of other member countries. The observers shall be appointed by the Commission acting through its Secretary and paid by the Government nominating them.    

22. Gunners and crews of factory ships, land stations, and whale catchers, shall be engaged on such terms that their remuneration shall depend to a considerable extent upon such factors as the species, size and yield of whales and not merely upon the number of the whales taken. No bonus or other remuneration shall be paid to the gunners or crews of whale catchers in respect of the taking of lactating whales.  

23. Whales must be measured when at rest on deck or platform after the hauling out wire and grasping device have been released, by means of a tape-measure made of a non-stretching material. The zero end of the tape-measure shall be attached to a spike or stable device to be positioned on the deck or platform abreast of one end of the whale. Alternatively the spike may be stuck into the tail fluke abreast of the apex of the notch. The tape-measure shall be held taut in a straight line parallel to the deck and the whale’s body, and other than in exceptional circumstances along the whale’s back, and read abreast of the other end of the whale. The ends of the whale for measurement purposes shall be the tip of the upper jaw, or in sperm whales the most forward part of the head, and the apex of the notch between the tail flukes. Measurements shall be logged to the nearest foot or 0.1 metre. That is to say, any whale between 75 feet 6 inches and 76 feet 6 inches shall be logged as 76 feet, and any whale between 76 feet 6 inches and 77 feet 6 inches shall be logged as 77 feet. Similarly, any whale between 10.15 metres and 10.25 metres shall be logged as 10.2 metres, and any whale between 10.25 metres and 10.35 metres shall be logged as 10.3 metres. The measurement of any whale which falls on an exact half foot or 0.05 metre shall be logged at the next half foot or 0.05 metre, e.g. 76 feet 6 inches precisely shall be logged as 77 feet and 10.25 metres precisely shall be logged as 10.3 metres.   
###VI. INFORMATION REQUIRED

24. 

a) All whale catchers operating in conjunction with a factory ship shall report by radio to the factory ship: 

1) the time when each whale is taken  

2) its species, and  

3) its marking effected pursuant to paragraph 20(b).    

b) The information specified in sub-paragraph a) of this paragraph shall be entered immediately by a factory ship in a permanent record which shall be available at all times for examination by the whaling inspectors; and in addition there shall be entered in such permanent record the following information as soon as it becomes available: 

1) time of hauling up for treatment  

2) length, measured pursuant to paragraph 23

b) A record similar to that described in sub-paragraph a) of this paragraph shall be maintained by vessels engaged in “small-type whaling” operations and by native peoples taking species listed in paragraph 1, and all the information mentioned in the said sub-paragraph shall be entered therein as soon as available, and forwarded by Contracting Governments to the Commission.    

26. 

a) Notification shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Convention, within two days after the end of each calendar week, of data on the number of baleen whales by species taken in any waters south of 40° South Latitude by all factory ships or whale catchers attached thereto under the jurisdiction of each Contracting Government, provided that when the number of each of these species taken is deemed by the Secretary to the International Whaling Commission to have reached 85 per cent of whatever total catch limit is imposed by the Commission notification shall be given as aforesaid at the end of each day of data on the number of each of these species taken.  

b) If it appears that the maximum catches of whales permitted by paragraph 11 may be reached before 7 April of any year, the Secretary to the International Whaling Commission shall determine, on the basis of the data provided, the date on which the maximum catch of each of these species shall be deemed to have been reached and shall notify the master of each factory ship and each Contracting Government of that date not less than four days in advance thereof. The taking or attempting to take baleen whales, so notified, by factory ships or whale catchers attached thereto shall be illegal in any waters south of 40° South Latitude after midnight of the date so determined.  

c) Notification shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Convention of each factory ship intending to engage in whaling operations in any waters south of 40° South Latitude.    

27. Notification shall be given in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of the Convention with regard to all factory ships and catcher ships of the following statistical information:

A. Fill in one column for each school chased with number of whales caught by each catcher taking part in the chase; if catchers chase the school but do not catch any whales from it, enter 0; for catchers in fleet which do not chase that school enter X.  

B. A school on this form moans a group of whales which are sufficiently close together that a catcher having completed handling one whale can start chasing another whale almost immediately without spending time searching. A solitary whale should be entered as a school of 1 whale.  

C. A takeable whale is a whale of a size or kind which the catchers would take if possible. It does not necessarily include all whales above legal size, e.g. if catchers are concentrating on large whales only these would be counted as takeable.  

D. Information about catchers from other expeditions or companies operating on the same school should be recorded under Remarks.     

####VERDRAG TOT REGELING VAN DE WALVISVANGST

De regeringen wier gemachtigde vertegenwoordigers hun instemming hiermede hebben betuigd; Erkennende het belang, dat de volkeren der wereld er bij hebben om de grote natuurlijke bronnen, vertegenwoordigd door de walvisstand voor toekomstige generaties veilig te stellen; In aanmerking nemende, dat in de geschiedenis van de walvisvangst een te intensieve vangst in het ene gebied na het andere is voorgekomen en op de ene soort walvis na de andere te sterk werd gejaagd, in zulke mate, dat het noodzakelijk is alle soorten walvissen te beschermen tegen verdere te sterke vangst; Erkennende, dat de walvisstand op natuurlijke wijze kan toenemen als de walvisvangst behoorlijk wordt geregeld, en dat een toename van de grootte van de walvisstand een toename van het aantal walvissen ten gevolge zal hebben, dat gevangen kan worden zonder deze natuurlijke hulpbronnen in gevaar te brengen; Erkennende, dat het van algemeen belang is, dat de walvisstand zo snel mogelijk op een optimaal peil wordt gebracht, zonder een algemene noodtoestand op het gebied van economie en voeding te veroorzaken; Erkennende, dat zolang deze doelstellingen nog niet zijn bereikt, de walvisvangst behoort te worden beperkt tot die soorten, welke het best tegen exploitatie bestand zijn ten einde bepaalde soorten walvissen, wier aantal sterk verminderd is, tijd te geven zich te herstellen. Er naar strevend de walvisvaart internationaal te regelen tot waarborging van een behoorlijke en doeltreffende instandhouding en ontwikkeling van de walvisstand volgens de beginselen, welke zijn neergelegd in de bepalingen van de Internationale Overeenkomst tot Regeling van de Walvisvangst, getekend te Londen op 8 Juni 1937 en de bij die Overeenkomst behorende Protocollen, getekend te Londen op 24 Juni 1938 en 26 November 1945; voorts Besloten hebbend een Verdrag te sluiten om te voorzien in een behoorlijke instandhouding van de walvisstand om op deze wijze een geregelde ontwikkeling van het walvisbedrijf mogelijk te maken,   Zijn het volgende overeengekomen:    

### Artikel  I  

1.  Tot dit Verdrag behoort het hieraan toegevoegde Reglement. Alle verwijzingen naar het Verdrag zullen tevens als verwijzing naar het Reglement worden beschouwd, hetzij in zijn tegenwoordige bewoordingen of zoals gewijzigd in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van artikel V.   
2.  Dit Verdrag is van toepassing op fabrieksschepen, landstations en jagers, die onder de rechtsbevoegdheid van de Verdragsluitende Regeringen vallen, alsmede op alle wateren, waar de walvisvangst wordt uitgeoefend door zulke fabrieksschepen, landstations en jagers.   

### Artikel  II  

In dit Verdrag wordt verstaan onder: 

1. „fabrieksschip”: een schip, waarin of waarop walvissen geheel of gedeeltelijk verwerkt worden;  

2. „landstation”: een bedrijf op het land, waar walvissen geheel of gedeeltelijk verwerkt worden;  

3. „jager”: een hefschroefvliegtuig of een ander luchtvaartuig of een schip, dat gebruikt wordt voor het jagen, vangen, doden, slepen, achtervolgen of opsporen van walvissen;  

4. „verdragsluitende Regering”: elke regering, die haar acte van ratificatie heeft neergelegd of van haar toetreding tot dit Verdrag heeft kennis gegeven.    

### Artikel  III  

1.  De verdragsluitende Regeringen komen overeen een Internationale Walvis Commissie in te stellen, hierna te noemen de Commissie, die zal zijn samengesteld uit een lid van iedere verdragsluitende Regering. Elk lid heeft een stem en mag vergezeld worden door één of meer deskundigen en adviseurs.   
2.  De Commissie kiest uit haar eigen leden een voorzitter en een vice-voorzitter en stelt haar eigen huishoudelijk reglement vast. Besluiten van de Commissie worden genomen bij gewone meerderheid van de door haar leden uitgebrachte stemmen, behoudens dat een 3/4 meerderheid van de door haar leden uitgebrachte stemmen vereist wordt voor handelingen volgens artikel V. Het huishoudelijk reglement kan voorzien in beslissingen buiten de vergaderingen van de Commissie.   
3.  De Commissie kan haar eigen secretaris en personeel benoemen.   
4.  De Commissie kan uit haar eigen leden en deskundigen of adviseurs speciale commissies samenstellen.   
5.  De uitgaven van elk lid van de Commissie en zijn deskundigen en adviseurs worden vastgesteld en betaald door zijn eigen Regering.   
6.  Aannemende, dat gespecialiseerde organisaties, die in betrekking staan tot de Verenigde Naties, zich zullen bezig houden met de instandhouding en ontwikkeling van de walvisvangst en met de producten, welke daaruit verkregen worden en dat het wenselijk is het waarnemen van dubbele functies te vermijden, zullen de verdragsluitende Regeringen, binnen twee jaar na het van kracht worden van dit Verdrag onderling overleg plegen over de vraag of de Commissie ondergebracht zal worden bij een gespecialiseerde organisatie, die in betrekking staat tot de Verenigde Naties.   
7.  Intussen treft de Regering van Groot-Brittannië en Noord-Ierland, in overleg met de andere verdragsluitende Regeringen, maatregelen om de eerste vergadering van de Commissie bijeen te roepen en maakt zij een aanvang met het hierboven in lid 6 bedoelde onderlinge overleg.   
8.  Daarna volgende vergaderingen van de Commissie worden bijeengeroepen, wanneer de Commissie zulks bepaalt.   

### Artikel  IV  

1.  De Commissie kan in samenwerking met of door middel van onafhankelijke instanties van de verdragsluitende Regeringen of andere publieke of particuliere instanties, instellingen of organisaties, dan wel zelfstandig:
