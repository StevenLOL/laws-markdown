I have the honour to confirm on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands the following understandings. With respect to Article 2, it is the understanding of the Parties that the term stability encompasses the term “security”. With respect to Article 12(1) and (2) it is the understanding of the Parties that the host State shall not withhold tax on interests and proceeds from investments by the International Commission on Missing Persons in so far as these interests and proceeds from investments are generated within the scope of the official activities of the International Commission on Missing Persons. Such official activities shall include investments made by ICMP in its Providence Fund or other pension, retirement or severance arrangements for the benefit of ICMP staff. With respect to Article 12(4) it is the understanding of the Parties that goods acquired or imported under the terms set out in paragraph 2 of Article 12 may be sold, let out, given away or otherwise disposed of, but only in accordance with conditions agreed upon with the host State. With respect to Article 16(1)(h) it is the understanding of the Parties that the words “at the time of first taking up their position in the host State” in general refers to a maximum period of twelve (12) months. With respect to Article 16(3) and (4) it is the understanding of the Parties that the International Commission on Missing Persons will inform the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands of the available ranks and/or job levels within its organization. ICMP will also inform the Protocol Department of the ranks it considers to be comparable to a diplomatic agent and the ranks it considers to be comparable to administrative and technical staff. The International Commission on Missing Persons will convey this information prior to the taking up of the position by the official. I should be grateful if you could confirm on behalf of the International Commission on Missing Persons that the above is also the understanding of the International Commission on Missing Persons. Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. *Sincerely,* A.G.
