####Protocol No. 2 to the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities concerning interterritorial co-operation

Preamble The member States of the Council of Europe signatory to this Protocol No. 2 to the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities, Considering the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Outline Convention, on 9 November 1995, concerning the legal effects of acts performed within the framework of transfrontier co-operation and of the legal status of any co-operation bodies set up by transfrontier co-operation agreements; Considering that in order to perform their functions effectively, territorial communities or authorities are increasingly co-operating not only with neighbouring authorities of other States (transfrontier co-operation), but also with foreign non-neighbouring authorities having common interests (interterritorial co-operation), and are doing so not only within the framework of transfrontier co-operation bodies and associations of territorial communities or authorities but also at bilateral level; Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration of 1993 of the Heads of State and government of the member States, which recognised the role of the Council of Europe in the creation of a tolerant and prosperous Europe through transfrontier co-operation of territorial communities or authorities; Noting that in the field of interterritorial co-operation there is no instrument comparable to the Outline Convention; Wishing to give interterritorial co-operation an international legal framework, Have agreed the following provisions:    

### Article  1  

For the purpose of this Protocol, “interterritorial co-operation" shall mean any concerted action designed to establish relations between territorial communities or authorities of two or more Contracting Parties, other than relations of transfrontier co-operation of neighbouring authorities, including the conclusion of co-operation agreements with territorial communities or authorities of other States.

For the purpose of the present Protocol, “ *mutatis mutandis* " means that in the Outline Convention and the additional Protocol the term “transfrontier co-operation" shall be read as “interterritorial co-operation" and that the articles of the Outline Convention and of the Additional Protocol shall apply unless otherwise provided by the present Protocol.

1.  Each Contracting Party to the Outline Convention and to the Additional Protocol shall declare, when signing this Protocol, or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, whether it will apply, pursuant to Article 4 of this Protocol, the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the Additional Protocol or one of those articles only.
