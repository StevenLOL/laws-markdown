3. All Discharges

a)Each Contracting Party shall take into account the impact that total nitrogen and phosphorus and their compounds may have on the degradation of the Convention area and, to the extent practicable, take appropriate measures to control or reduce the amount of total nitrogen and phosphorus that is discharged into, or may adversely affect, the Convention area.

b)Each Party shall ensure that residual chlorine from domestic wastewater treatment systems is not discharged in concentrations or amounts that would be toxic to marine organisms that reside in or migrate to the Convention area.

###D 

####Industrial Pretreatment

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

Each Contracting Party shall endeavour, in keeping with its economic capabilities, to develop and implement industrial pretreatment programmes to ensure that industrial discharges into new and existing domestic wastewater treatment systems:

a)do not interfere with, damage or otherwise prevent domestic wastewater collection and treatment systems from meeting the effluent limitations specified in this Annex;

b)do not endanger operations of, or populations in proximity to, collection and treatment systems through exposure to toxic and hazardous substances;

c)do not contaminate sludges or other reusable products from wastewater treatment; and

d)do not contain toxic pollutants in amounts toxic to human health and/or aquatic life.Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to ensure that industrial pretreatment programmes include spill containment and contingency plans.Each Contracting Party, within the scope of its capabilities, shall promote appropriate industrial wastewater management, such as the use of recirculation and closed loop systems, to eliminate or minimise wastewater discharges to domestic wastewater systems.

###E 

####Household Systems

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

Each Contracting Party shall strive to, as expeditiously, economically and technologically feasible, in areas without sewage collection, ensure that household systems are constructed, operated and maintained to avoid contamination of surface or ground waters that are likely to adversely affect the Convention area.For those household systems requiring septage pump out, each Contracting Party shall strive to ensure that the septage is treated through a domestic wastewater system or appropriate land application.

###F 

####Management, Operations and Maintenance

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

Each Contracting Party shall ensure that new and existing domestic wastewater systems are properly managed and that system managers develop and implement training programmes for wastewater collection and treatment system operators. Managers and operators shall have access to operators' manuals and technical support necessary for proper system operation.Each Contracting Party shall provide for an evaluation of domestic wastewater systems by competent national authorities to assess compliance with national regulations.

###G 

####Extension Period

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

1. Any Contracting Party may, at least two years before the effective date of an obligation in categories 2, 3, 4 or 5 of the timetable in Part C above, submit to the Organisation a declaration that, with respect to such category, it is unable to achieve the effluent limitations set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Part C above in accordance with that timetable, provided that such Contracting Party:

a)has developed action plans pursuant to Part B, paragraph 1(e);

b)has achieved the effluent limitations for a subset of the discharges associated with those categories, or a reduction of at least 5 percent of total loading of pollutants associated with those categories; and

c)has taken actions to achieve those effluent limitations, but has been unable to achieve those limitations due to a lack of financial or other capacity.2. With respect to a Contracting Party that has submitted a declaration pursuant to paragraph 1 above, the effective date of an obligation in the timetable in Part C for categories 2, 3, 4 or 5 of that timetable shall be extended for a period of five years. The five-year period shall be extended for a maximum of one additional five-year period if the Contracting Party submits a new declaration prior to the expiration of the first period, and if it continues to meet the requirements set out in paragraph 1 above. 3. The Contracting Parties recognise that the complete fulfilment* of the obligations contained in this Annex will require the availability and accessibility of financial resources.* In this context, the Spanish word ‚Äúcumplimiento" that appears in the Spanish text shall have the meaning of the English word ‚Äúfulfilment" and not ‚Äúcompliance".

###Annex IV 

####Agricultural Non-Point Sources of Pollution

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

###A 

####Definitions

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

For purposes of this Annex:1. ‚ÄúAgricultural non-point sources of pollution" means non-point sources of pollution originating from the cultivation of crops and rearing of domesticated animals, excluding intensive animal rearing operations that would otherwise be defined as point sources; and2. ‚ÄúBest management practices" means economical and achievable structural or non-structural measures designed to prevent, reduce or control the run-off of pollutants into the Convention area.

###B 

####Plans for the Prevention, Reduction and Control of Agricultural Non-Point Sources of Pollution

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

Each Contracting Party shall, no later than five years after this Annex enters into force for it, formulate policies, plans and legal mechanisms for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the Convention area from agricultural non-point sources of pollution that may adversely affect the Convention area. Programmes shall be identified in such policies, plans and legal mechanisms to mitigate pollution of the Convention area from agricultural non-point sources of pollution, in particular, if these sources contain nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), pesticides, sediments, pathogens, solid waste or other such pollutants that may adversely affect the Convention area. Plans shall include inter alia the following elements:1. An evaluation and assessment of agricultural non-point sources of pollution that may adversely affect the Convention area, which may include: 

a)an estimation of loadings that may adversely affect the Convention area;

b)an identification of associated environmental impacts and potential risks to human health;

c)the evaluation of the existing administrative framework to manage agricultural non-point sources of pollution;

d)an evaluation of existing best management practices and their effectiveness; and

e)the establishment of monitoring programmes.2. Education, training and awareness programmes, which may include:

a)the establishment and implementation of programmes for the agricultural sector and the general public to raise awareness of agricultural non-point sources of pollution and their impacts on the marine environment, public health and the economy;

b)the establishment and implementation of programmes at all levels of education on the importance of the marine environment and the impact of pollution from agricultural activities;

c)the establishment and implementation of training programmes for government agencies and the agricultural sector on the implementation of best management practices, including the development of guidance materials for agricultural workers on structural and non-structural best management practices, to prevent, reduce and control agricultural non-point sources of pollution; and

d)the establishment of programmes to facilitate effective technology transfer and information exchange.3. The development and promotion of economic and non-economic incentive programmes to increase the use of best management practices to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the Convention area from agricultural non-point sources.4. An assessment and evaluation of legislative and policy measures, including a review of the adequacy of plans, policies and legal mechanisms directed toward the management of agricultural non-point sources and the development of a plan to implement such modifications as may be necessary to achieve best management practices.

###C 

####Reporting

Treedt in werking op een nader te bepalen tijdstip 

Each Contracting Party shall report on its plans for prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the Convention area from agricultural non-point sources in accordance with Article XII of this Protocol.
