#### Protocol to the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials

The contracting States parties to the Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials, adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its fifth session held in Florence in 1950, Reaffirming the principles on which the Agreement, hereinaftercalled “the Agreement”, is based, Considering that this Agreement has proved to be an effective instrument in lowering customs barriers and reducing other economic restrictions that impede the exchange of ideas and knowledge, Considering, nevertheless, that in the quarter of a century following the adoption of the Agreement, technical progress has changed the ways and means of transmitting information and knowledge, which is the fundamental objective of that Agreement, Considering, further, that the developments that have taken place in the field of international trade during this period have, in general, been reflected in greater freedom of exchanges, Considering that since the adoption of the Agreement, the international situation has changed radically owing to the development of the international community, in particular through the accession of many States to independence, Considering that the needs and concerns of the developing countries should be taken into consideration, with a view to giving them easier and less costly access to education, science, technology and culture, Recalling the provisions of the Convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property, adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1970, and those of the Convention concerning the protection of the world cultural and natural heritage, adopted by the General Conference in 1972, Recalling, moreover, the customs conventions concluded under the auspices of the Customs Co-operation Council, in consultation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, concerning the temporary importation of educational, scientific and cultural materials, Convinced that new arrangements should be made and that such arrangements will contribute even more effectively to the development of education, science and culture which constitute the essential bases of economic and social progress, Recalling resolution 4.112 adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO at its eighteenth session,   Have agreed as follows:
