If the creditor does not specify a currency, the choice shall rest with the debtor.  

3.1.2 If a creditor selects a currency with a value fixed unilaterally or a currency the equivalent value of which is to be determined by its relationship to a currency with a value also fixed unilaterally, the use of the selected currency must be acceptable to the debtor.

3.2.1 The amount of the payment in the selected currency, as determined below, shall be equivalent in value to the balance of the account.

3.2.3 However, if the relationship of the monetary unit of the IMF to the selected currency has not been published, the amount of the balance of account shall, at a first stage, be converted into a currency for which a relationship has been published by the IMF, using the relationship in effect on the day before payment or the latest published relationship. The amount thus obtained shall, at a second stage, be converted into the equivalent value of the selected currency, using the closing rate in effect on the day prior to payment or the most recent rate quoted on the official or generally accepted foreign exchange market of the main financial centre of the debtor country.  

3.2.4 If the balance of the account is expressed in gold francs, the amount shall, in the absence of special arrangements, be converted into the monetary unit of the IMF in accordance with the provisions of section 6.3 of the Regulations. The amount of payment shall then be determined in compliance with the provisions of 3.2.2 above.  

3.2.5 If, in accordance with a special arrangement, the balance of the account is expressed neither in the monetary unit of the IMF nor in gold francs, the payment shall also be the subject of this special arrangement and:

b) if the selected currency for payment is different from the currency in which the balance is expressed, the amount shall be determined by converting the balance of account to its equivalent value in the selected currency in accordance with the provisions of 3.2.3 above.       
3.3.   *Payment of balances*  

3.3.1 Payment of balances of account shall be effected as promptly as possible, but in no case later than two calendar months after the day on which the settlement statement is despatched by the creditor administration . Beyond this period, the creditor administration may, subject to prior notification in the form of a final demand for payment, and unless otherwise agreed, charge interest at a rate of up to 6% per annum, reckoned form the day following the date of expiry of the said period. <sup> *  or recognized private operating agency(ies)  </sup> <sup> *  or recognized private operating agency(ies)  </sup>  

3.3.2 The payment due on a settlement statement shall not be delayed pending settlement of a query on that account. Adjustments which are later agreed shall be included in a subsequent account.  

3.3.3 On the date of payment, the debtor shall transmit the amount of the selected currency as computed above by a bank cheque, transfer or any other means acceptable to the debtor and the creditor. If the creditor expresses no preference, the choice shall fall to the debtor.  

3.3.4 The payment charges imposed in the debtor country (taxes, clearing charges, commissions, etc.) shall be borne by the debtor. Any such charges imposed in the creditor country, including payment charges imposed by intermediate banks in third countries, shall be borne by the creditor.     
3.4.   *Additional provisions*  

3.4.1 3.4.1 Provided the periods of payment are observed, administrations may by mutual agreement settle their balances of various kinds by offsetting: <sup> *  or recognized private operating agency(ies)  </sup> 

- credits and debits in their relations with other administrations ; and/or <sup> *  or recognized private operating agency(ies)  </sup>  

- debts arising from postal services, if appropriate.    

3.4.2 If, between the time the remittance (bank transfer, cheques, etc.) is effected and the time the creditor is in receipt of that remittance (account credited, cheque encashed, etc.), a variation occures in the equivalent value of the selected currency calculated as indicated in paragraph 3.2, and if the difference resulting from such variations exceeds 5% of the amount due as calculated following such variations, the total difference shall be shared equally between debtor and creditor.  

3.4.3 If there should be a redical change in the international monetary system which invalidates or makes inappropriate one or more of the foregoing paragraphs, administrations are free to adopt, by mutual agreement, a different monetary basis and/or different procedures for the settlement of balances of accounts, pending a revision of the above provisions. <sup> *  or recognized private operating agency(ies)  </sup>

####FINAL PROTOCOL

At the time of signing the Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (Melbourne, 1988), the undersigned delegates take note of the following statements made by signatory delegations: 
### *NO. 35* 

*Original*:English/French/Spanish  *For the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:*  In signing the Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (Melbourne, 1988), the Delegations of the above-mentioned Members of the Union, being Member States of the European Economic Community, declare that these States will apply the International Telecommunication Regulations in accordance with their obligations under the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community. 
### *NO. 44* 

*Original:* English  *For the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:*  In signing these Regulations, the Delegation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland wishes to reaffirm its Government's commitment to the development of competition in the provision of international telecommunication infrastructure and services. It believes such competition to be in the interest of telecommunications users, and economic development generally. Every effort should be made, where practicable, to meet the reasonable preferences of customers. In implementing the provisions of the Regulations, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland intends to be guided, as appropriate, by these principles. It wishes, in particular, to disassociate itself from those parts of Opinion No. 1 which it believes may suggest views contrary to these principles. 
### *NO. 55* 

*Original*:Spanish  *For Spain:*  With reference to the reservations made by a number of delegations in connection with the conditions required for the provision of international telecommunication services, the Delegation of Spain at the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (Melbourne, 1988) declares that such reservations will under no circumstances constitute a valid argument for the avoidance of the application of Spanish national law on the part of any entity which directly intends to provide such services on the territory of Spain or via the Spanish telecommunication network. 
### *NO. 73* 

*Original*: English  *For the Kingdom of the Netherlands:*  The Delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands has accepted the Regulations set at the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (Melbourne, 1988) because it sees these Regulations as a balanced package serving the harmonious and efficient development, operation and use of telecommunications world-wide. Noting that several Members of the Union have made reservations on their position towards the principles and provisions with regard to special arrangements contained in the Regulations which have consequences on the balanced contents of these Regulations, the Delegation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore formally declares that it does not endorse in any way procedures requiring approval for providers of telecommunication services and services dependent on telecommunication transport in those Member countries.
