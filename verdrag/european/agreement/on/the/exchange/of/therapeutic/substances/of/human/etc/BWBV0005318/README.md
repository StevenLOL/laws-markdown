###Freedom from toxicity of plastic blood transfusion equipment

###*I. Chemical tests*

The tests are intended to be applied to plastics blood transfusion equipment. This equipment consists of two main categories:

(1)plastics containers for the collection, separation and storage of blood and blood products;

(2)plastics sets for taking and giving blood. The tests shall be carried out on the materials after they have been sterilised by the method to be used in the final sterilisation of the equipment. These materials shall include:

1) the plastics used to make the containers,  

2) the tubing used in the containers and 

3)the blood-taking and giving sets. The tests on containers shall be carried out before the containers are filled with anticoagulant solution. However, if the tests are carried out on containers which have been filled with anticoagulant solution, the limit tests in Section III on the anticoagulant solution itself shall be taken into account when evaluating the results of the tests on the container.The manufacturer of the transfusion equipment is required to disclose to the appropriate health authority the detailed formulations of the plastics material or materials and other materials used in the manufacture of the equipment, the source of the components of the material or materials and their methods of manufacture (or alternatively, the compound reference numbers), details of manufacture of the equipment, the nature of any processing additives and adhesives and the method of sterilisation. No change shall be permitted in any of the foregoing without prior submission to and approval of the appropriate health authority.Each batch of raw material used in the manufacture of the equipment shall be identified by a batch number, which shall be recorded by the manufacturer of the equipment together with the identification numbers of all batches of transfusion equipment made from it and the results of all tests relevant to these batches.Every practicable precaution must be taken to reduce the risk of adventitious contamination at each stage of the manufacturing process.
###A. Preparation of extract and blank

(a)A total test as described below requires 1250 cm<sup>2</sup> plastics (total surface area, both sides, of a plastics sample in sheet form with surface area of 625 cm<sup>2</sup>). The sample - without any printing or label on it - should be cut into pieces of not more than 10 cm<sup>2</sup>.For tubing the length (L) in cm is calculated as follows: ![10000055006](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055006)
D<sub>1</sub> = inner diameter in cmD<sub>2</sub> = outer diameter in cmThe tubing should be cut lengthwise into sections measuring approximately 10 cm. For the extraction 10 ml of water is used per surface area of 50 cm<sup>2</sup>.

(b)The pieces of plastics film or tubing should be placed in a container of borosilicate glass with 250 ml pyrogen-free distilled water obtained from an efficient still having glass condensation surfaces and collecting tubes.<sup>1If the plastics have been in contact with an anticoagulant solution, the pieces should first be placed in a similar container with cold distilled water (100 ml) and shaken several times. This should be repeated once.</sup> The opening of the container is covered with an inverted beaker and the container is then heated in saturated steam at 110° C for 30 minutes (autoclaving) and then quickly cooled to room temperature and the volume adjusted to 250 ml with pyrogen-free distilled water. It is of no significance if the plastics specimens tend to stick together slightly. Heat-sensitive plastics material, instead of being heated in an autoclave, may be heated at 70° C for 72 hours. A blank preparation is made in a corresponding manner omitting the plastics.
###B. Tests on the extract

1. *Oxidisable matter*To 20 ml of the extract in an Erlenmeyer flask of borosilicate glass add 20 ml of 2 millimole potassium permanganate solution per litre and 1.0 ml of 1 mole sulphuric acid per litre and boil the mixture for 3 minutes. Cool the solution rapidly and add 0.1 g of potassium iodide and 5 drops of starch solution. Titrate with a solution containing 10 millimole sodium thiosulphate per litre. At the same time carry out a blank titration. The difference in the volume of thiosulphate used in the two titrations does not exceed 2.00 ml a solution containing 10 millimole sodium thiosulphate per litre.

2. *Chloride*The extract complies with a suitable limit test for chloride equivalent to not more than 11.2 µmole chloride per litre.

3. *Ammonia*The extract complies with a suitable limit test for ammonia equivalent to not more than 120 µmole NHs per litre.

4. *Phosphoric Acid - Phosphate*The extract complies with the limit test for phosphate.*Limit test for phosphate* Evaporate 25 ml of the extract almost to dryness in a Kjeldahl flask, cool the residue, add 2 drops sulphuric acid and 1 ml nitric acid, heat the mixture until white fumes appear, then cool. Add 1 drop of perchloric acid and heat gently for half an hour. Cool the residue and add water to 25 ml. Transfer 10 ml of the solution to a 25 ml titration flask, add 8 ml ammonium molybdate-sulphuric acid solution and 2 ml of freshly prepared solution of ascorbic acid, having a concentration of 100 g/l. Heat on a water bath at 50° C for thirty minutes, cool and dilute the mixture to 25 ml. The green or blue colour of the solution is not more intense than that obtained by treating 25 ml of the blank solution in the same manner.

5. *Acidity or alkalinity*10 ml of the extract is not coloured red on the addition of 2 drops of phenolphthalein solution and requires not more than 0.4 ml solution containing 10 millimole sodium hydroxide per litre to produce a red colour. After removal of the colour by the addition of 0.08 ml solution containing 10 millimole hydrochloric acid per litre, the addition of 5 drops of methyl red solution produces a red or orange-red colour.

6. *Residue on evaporation*Evaporate 100 ml of the extract to dryness on a water bath and dry at 105° C to constant weight. The residue weighs not more than 5.0 mg.

7. *Clarity and colour*The extract when viewed through a thickness of 5 cm is clear and colourless when compared with the blank.

8. *Taste and smell*The extract compared with the blank is odourless and tasteless.

9. *Special elements*The extract complies with suitable limit tests for

(i) any of the following elements: arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, silicon, silver and tin, equivalent to 1 µg/g  

(ii) cadmium, equivalent to 0.1µg/g  

10. *Residue on ignition*1.0 g of the plastics material when ignited to constant weight leaves not more than 1 mg of residue.

11. *Heavy metals*Dissolve the residue on ignition in the minimum quantity of a solution of 2 mole hydrochloric acid per litre, heating if necessary. Carry out a suitable limit test for heavy metals. The plastics material complies with a limit not exceeding 5 microgrammes per gramme as calculated as Pb.

### Appendix  

####Biological test: limits and methods

###A. Test for undue toxicity

(See Item II, 1 of Annex above): limit as specified in national pharmacopoeia.
###B. Test for freedom from pyrogens

(See Item II, 2 of Annex above): limit as specified in national pharmacopoeia.
###C. Test for haemolytic effects in buffered systems

(See Item II, 3 of Annex above):

(a)*Limit:* A salt solution equivalent to a solution containing 5.0 gram NaCl per litre, in so far as electrolyte osmotic action is concerned, shall not produce a haemolysis value higher than 10% and a salt solution of 4.0 gram per litre shall not differ by more than 10% in haemolysis value from that caused by the corresponding control solution.

(b)*Method:*From the primary buffer stock solution for haemolysis three solutions are prepared: 30 ml buffer stock solution and 10 ml water (solution a<sub>0</sub>), 30 ml buffer stock solution and 20 ml water (solution b<sub>0</sub>) and 15 ml buffer stock solution and 85 ml water (solution c<sub>0</sub>). To each of three centrifuge tubes (1, 2 and 3), 1.40 ml extract are added. To tube 1 is added 0.10 ml a<sub>0</sub>, to tube 2, 0.10 ml b<sub>0</sub> and to tube 3, 0.10 ml c<sub>0</sub>, thus obtaining salt solutions equivalent to solutions containing 5.0 (tube 1), 4.0 (tube 2) and 1.0 gram NaCl per litre (tube 3) in so far as electrolyte osmotic action is concerned. To each tube is added 20 µl fresh, well mixed heparinised human blood. The tubes are put into a water bath at 30° C (± 1° C) for 40 minutes. Then three solutions containing 3.0 ml a<sub>o</sub> and 12.0 ml water (solution a <sub>i </sub>) 4.0 ml b<sub>0</sub> and 11.0 ml water (solution b<sub>i </sub>), and 4.75 ml b<sub>0</sub> and 10.25 ml water (solution c<sub>1</sub>) are prepared. To the first tube is added 1.50 ml of a<sub>1</sub>, to the second 1.50 ml of b<sub>1</sub> and to the third 1.50 ml of c<sub>1</sub>. The tubes are centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2,000 to 2,500 rpm in a swing-out centrifuge. Concurrently, control solutions, in which the extract is replaced with water, are prepared for each of the concentrations. The extinction at 540 nm of the liquid layer is measured. Buffer stock solution for haemolysis is used as blank. The haemolysis value in per cent is calculated according to the following formula:  ![10000055008](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000055008)
where E100%= extinction for the solution containing an equivalent of 1.0 gram salt per litre and E<sub>exp</sub> = extinction for the solutions containing an equivalent of 4.0 and 5.0 gram salt per litre respectively
### *Buffer stock solution for haemolysis*

90.0 g sodium chloride, 13,7 g anhydrous disodium phosphate and 1.90 g anhydrous monosodium phosphate are dissolved in distilled water and made up to 1000.0 ml. 
###D. Test for the in vivo survival of red cells
