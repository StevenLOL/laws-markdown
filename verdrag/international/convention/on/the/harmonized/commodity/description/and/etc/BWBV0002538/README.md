##Internationaal Verdrag betreffende het geharmoniseerde systeem inzake de omschrijving en de codering van goederen

####International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System

Preamble The Contracting Parties to this Convention, established under the auspices of the Customs Co-operation Council, Desiring to facilitate international trade, Desiring to facilitate the collection, comparison and analysis of statistics, in particular those on international trade, Desiring to reduce the expense incurred by redescribing, reclassifying and recoding goods as they move from one classification system to another in the course of international trade and to facilitate the standardization of trade documentation and the transmission of data, Considering that changes in technology and the patterns of international trade require extensive modifications to the Convention on Nomenclature for the Classification of Goods in Customs Tariffs, done at Brussels on 15 December 1950, Considering also that the degree of detail required for Customs and statistical purposes by Governments and trade interests has increased far beyond that provided by the Nomenclature annexed to the above-mentioned Convention, Considering the importance of accurate and comparable data for the purposes of international trade negotiations, Considering that the Harmonized System is intended to be used for the purposes of freight tariffs and transport statistics of the various modes of transport, Considering that the Harmonized System is intended to be incorporated into commercial commodity description and coding systems to the greatest extent possible, Considering that the Harmonized System is intended to promote as close a correlation as possible between import and export trade statistics and production statistics, Considering that a close correlation should be maintained between the Harmonized System and the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) of the United Nations, Considering the desirability of meeting the aforementioned needs through a combined tariff/statistical nomenclature, suitable for use by the various interests concerned with international trade, Considering the importance of ensuring that the Harmonized System is kept up-to-date in the light of changes in technology or in patterns of international trade, Having taken into consideration the work accomplished in this sphere by the Harmonized System Committee set up by the Customs Co-operation Council, Considering that while the above-mentioned Nomenclature Convention has proved an effective instrument in the attainment of some of these objectives, the best way to achieve the desired results in this respect is to conclude a new international Convention, Have agreed as follows:    

### Article  1

### Article  3  

####Obligations of Contracting Parties

1.  Subject to the exceptions enumerated in Article 4: 

(a) Each Contracting Party undertakes, except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, that from the date on which this Convention enters into force in respect of it, its Customs tariff and statistical nomenclatures shall be in conformity with the Harmonized System. It thus undertakes that, in respect of its Customs tariff and statistical nomenclatures: 

(i) it shall use all the headings and subheadings of the Harmonized System without addition or modification, together with their related numerical codes;  

(ii) it shall apply the General Rules for the interpretation of the Harmonized System and all the Section, Chapter and Subheading Notes, and shall not modify the scope of the Sections, Chapters, headings or subheadings of the Harmonized System; and  

(iii) it shall follow the numerical sequence of the Harmonized System;    

(b) Each Contracting Party shall also make publicly available its import and export trade statistics in conformity with the six-digit codes of the Harmonized System, or, on the initiative of the Contracting Party, beyond that level, to the extent that publication is not precluded for exceptional reasons such as commercial confidentiality or national security;  

(c) Nothing in this Article shall require a Contracting Party to use the subheadings of the Harmonized System in its Customs tariff nomenclature provided that it meets the obligations at (a) (i), (a) (ii) and (a) (iii) above in a combined tariff/statistical nomenclature.     
2.  In complying with the undertakings at paragraph 1 (a) of this Article, each Contracting Party may make such textual adaptations as may be necessary to give effect to the Harmonized System in its domestic law.   
3.  Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Contracting Party from establishing, in this Customs tariff or statistical nomenclatures, subdivisions classifying goods beyond the level of the Harmonized System, provided that any such subdivision is added and coded at a level beyond that of the six-digit numerical code set out in the Annex to this Convention.   

### Article  4  

####Partial application by developing countries

1.  Any developing country Contracting Party may delay its application of some or all of the subheadings of the Harmonized System for such period as may be necessary, having regard to its pattern of international trade or its administrative resources.

3.  A developing country Contracting Party which elects to apply the Harmonized System partially under the provisions of this Article shall apply all or none of the two-dash subheadings of any one one-dash subheading or all or none of the one-dash subheadings of any one heading. In such cases of partial application, the sixth digit or the fifth and sixth digits of that part of the Harmonized System code not applied shall be replaced by "0" or "00" respectively.   
4.  A developing country which elects to apply the Harmonized System partially under the provisions of this Article shall on becoming a Contracting Party notify the Secretary General of those subheadings which it will not apply on the date when this Convention enters into force in respect of it and shall also notify the Secretary General of those subheadings which it applies thereafter.

###GENERAL RULES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HARMONIZED SYSTEM

Classification of goods in the Nomenclature shall be governed by the following principles: 

1. The titles of Sections, Chapters and sub-Chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative Section or Chapter Notes and, provided such headings or Notes do not otherwise require, according to the following provisions:  

2. 
(a) Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article. It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or falling to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this Rule), presented unassembled or disassembled.  

(b) Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substances. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of Rule 3.    

3. When by application of Rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are, *prima facie*, classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows: 

(a) The heading which provides the most specific description shall be preferred to headings providing a more general description. However, when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, those headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods.  

(b) Mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by ref ere rice to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, insofar as this criterion Is applicable.  

(c) When goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or 3 (b), they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.    

4. Goods which cannot be classified in accordance with the above Rules shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.  

5. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following Rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein: 

(a) Camera cases, musical Instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and simitar containers, specially shaped or fitted to contain a spccillc article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally sold therewith. This Rule does not, however, apply to containers which give the whole its essential character;  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Rule 5 (a) above, packing materials and packing containers presented with the goods therein shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision is not binding when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.

###Chapter 27

###Mineral fuels, mineral oils and products of their distillation; bituminous substances; mineral waxes

Notes. 1.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds, other than pure methane and propane which are to be classified in heading 27.11; (b) Medicaments of heading 30.03 or 30.04; or (c) Mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons of heading 33.01, 33.02 or 38.05. 2.- References in heading 27.10 to "petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals" include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents. However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 °C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter 39). 3.- For the purposes of heading 27.10, "waste oils" means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in Note 2 to this Chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include: 

a) Such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils);  

b) Sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and  

c) Such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.   Subheading Notes. 1.- For the purposes of subheading 2701.11, "anthracite" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) not exceeding 14 %. 2.- For the purposes of subheading 2701.12, "bituminous coal" means coal having a volatile matter limit (on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis) exceeding 14 % and a calorific value limit (on a moist, mineral-matterfree basis) equal to or greater than 5,833 kcal/kg. 3.- For the purposes of subheadings 2707.10, 2707.20, 2707.30 and 2707.40 the terms ‘‘benzol (benzene)’’, ‘‘toluol (toluene)’’, ‘‘xylol (xylenes)’’ and ‘‘naphthalene’’ apply to products which contain more than 50 % by weight of benzene, toluene, xylenes or naphthalene, respectively. 4.- For the purposes of subheading 2710.11, "light oils and preparations" are those of which 90% or more by volume (including losses) distil at 210°C (ASTM D 86 method).

###Chapter 29

###Organic chemicals

Notes. 1. Except where the context otherwise requires, the headings of this Chapter apply only to : (a) Separate chemically defined organic compounds, whether or not containing impurities; (b) Mixtures of two or more isomers of the same organic compound (whether or not containing impurities), except mixtures of acyclic hydrocarbon isomers (other than stereoisomers), whether or not saturated (Chapter 27); (c) The products of headings 29.36 to 29.39 or the sugar ethers, sugar acetals and sugar esters, and their salts, of heading 29.40, or the products of heading 29.41, whether or not chemically defined; (d) The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in water; (e) The products mentioned in (a), (b) or (c) above dissolved in other solvents provided that the solution constitutes a normal and necessary method of putting up these products adopted solely for reasons of safety or for transport and that the solvent does not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; (f) The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above with an added stabiliser (including an anti-caking agent) necessary for their preservation or transport; (g)The products mentioned in (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring or odoriferous substance added to facilitate their identification or for safety reasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use; (h)The following products, diluted to standard strengths, for the production of azo dyes: diazonium salts, couplers used for these salts and diazotisable amines and their salts. 2.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Goods of heading 15.04 or crude glycerol of heading 15.20; (b) Ethyl alcohol (heading 22.07 or 22.08); (c) Methane or propane (heading 27.11); (d)The compounds of carbon mentioned in Note 2 to Chapter 28; (e) Urea (heading 31.02 or 31.05); (f) Colouring matter of vegetable or animal origin (heading 32.03), synthetic organic colouring matter, synthetic organic products of a kind used as fluorescent brightening agents or as luminophores (heading 32.04) or dyes or other colouring matter put up in forms or packings for retail sale (heading 32.12); (g) Enzymes (heading 35.07); (h) Metaldehyde, hexamethyleneletramine or similar substances, put up in forms (for example, tablets, sticks or similar forms) for use as fuels, or liquid or liquefied-gas fuels in containers of a kind used for filling or refilling cigarette or similar lighters and of a capacity not exceeding 300 cm3 (heading 36.06); (ij) Products put up as charges for fire-extinguishers or put up in fireextinguishing grenades, of heading 38.13; ink removers put up in packings for retail sale, of heading 38.24; or (k) Optical elements, for example, of ethylenediamine tartrate (heading 90.01). 3.- Goods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this Chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order. 4.- In headings 29.04 to 29.06, 29.08 to 29.11 and 29.13 to 29.20, any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivatives, such as sulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nltrosulphonated or nitrosulphohatogenated derivatives. Nitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as "nitrogen-functions" for the purposes of heading 29.29. For the purposes of headings 29.11, 29.12, 29.14. 29.18 and 29.22, "oxygen-function" is to be restricted to the functions (the characteristic organic oxygen-containing groups) referred to in headings 29.05 to 29.20. 5.- (A) The esters of acid-function organic compounds of sub-Chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these sub-Chapters are to be classified with that compound which is classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in these sub-Chapters. (B) Esters of ethyl alcohol with acid-function organic compounds of sub-Chapters 1 to VII are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds. (C) Subject to Note 1 to Section VI and Note 2 to Chapter 28: (1) Inorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-, phenol- or enol-function compounds or organic bases, of sub-Chapters I to X or heading 29.42, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the organic compound; (2) Salts formed between organic compounds of sub-Chapters I to X or heading 29.42 are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol- or enol-function compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the Chapter; and (3) Co-ordination compounds, other than products classifiable in sub-Chapter XI or heading 29.41, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in Chapter 29, among those appropriate to the fragments formed by ‘‘cleaving’’ of all metal bonds, other than metal-carbon bonds. (D) Metal alcoholates are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol (heading 29.05). (E) Halides of carboxylic acids are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acids. 6.- The compounds of headings 29.30 and 29.31 are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non-metals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms. Heading No. 29.30 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading 29.31 (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives). 7.- Headings Nos. 29.32, 29.33 and 29.34 do not include epoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids. These provisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising function or functions here listed. 8.- For the purposes of heading 29.37: 

a) the term "hormones" includes hormone-releasing or hormone-stimulating factors, hormone inhibitors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones);  

b) the expression "used primarily as hormones" applies not only to hormone derivatives and structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and structural analogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading.   Subheading Notes. 1.- Within any one heading of this Chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds) provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named "Other" in the series of subheadings concerned. 2. - Note 3 to Chapter 29 does not apply to the subheadings of this Chapter.

Notes 1.- Goods put up in sets consisting of two or more separate constituents, some or all of which fall in this Section and are intended to be mixed together to obtain a product of Section VI or VII, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to that product, provided that the constituents are: (a) having regard to the manner in which they are put up, clearly identifiable as being intended to be used together without first being repacked; (b) presented together; and (c) identifiable, whether by their nature or by the relative proportions in which they are present, as being complementary one to another. 2.- Except for the goods of heading 39.18 or 39.19, plastics, rubber, and articles thereof, printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, fall in Chapter 49. 
###Chapter 39

###Plastics and articles thereof

Notes. 1.- Throughout the Nomenclature the expression "plastics" means those materials of headings 39.01 to 39.14 which are or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerisation or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser) by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence. Throughout the Nomenclature any reference to "plastics" also includes vulcanised fibre. The expression, however, does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of Section XI. 2.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Lubricating preparations of heading 27.10 or 34.03; (b) Waxes of heading 27.12 or 34.04; (c) Separate chemically defined organic compounds (Chapter 29); (d) Heparin or its salts (heading 30.01); (e) Solutions (other than collodions) consisting of any of the products specified in headings 39.01 to 39.13 in volatile organic solvents when the weight of the solvent exceeds 50 % of the weight of the solution (heading 32.08); stamping foils of heading 32.12; (f) Organic surface-active agents or preparations of heading 34.02; (g) Run gums or ester gums (heading 38.06); (h) Prepared additives for mineral oils (including gasoline) or for other liquids used for the same purposes as mineral oils (heading 38.11); (ij) Prepared hydraulic fluids based on polyglycols, silicones or other polymers of Chapter 39 (heading 38.19); (k) Diagnostic or laboratory reagents on a backing of plastics (heading 38.22); (l) Synthetic rubber, as defined for the purposes of Chapter 40, or articles thereof; (m) Saddlery or harness (heading 42.01) or trunks, suitcases, handbags or other containers of heading 42.02; (n) Plaits, wickerwork or other articles of Chapter 46; (o) Wall coverings of heading 48.14; (I) Goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles); (m) Articles of Section XII (for example, footwear, headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, whips, riding-crops or parts thereof); (p) Imitation jewellery of heading 71.17; (q) Articles of Section XVI (machines and mechanical or electrical appliances); (r) Parts of aircraft or vehicles of Section XVII; (s) Articles of Chapter 90 (for example, optical elements, spectacle frames, drawing instruments); (t) Articles of Chapter 91 (for example, clock or watch cases); (u) Articles of Chapter 92 (for example, musical instruments or parts thereof); (v) Articles of Chapter 94 (for example, furniture, lamps and lighting fittings, illuminated signs, prefabricated buildings); (w) Articles of Chapter 95 (for example, toys, games, sports requisites); or (x) Articles of Chapter 96 (for example, brushes, buttons, slide fasteners, combs, mouthpieces or sterns for smoking pipes, cigarette holders or the like, parts of vacuum flasks or the like, pens, propelling pencils). 3.- Headings Nos. 39.01 to 39.11 apply only to goods of a kind produced by chemical synthesis, falling in the following categories : (a) Liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60 % by volume distils at 300 °C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced pressure distillation method is used (headings 39.01 and 39.02); (b) Resins, not highly polymerised, of the coumarone-indene type (heading 39.11); (c) Other synthetic polymers with an average of at least 5 monomer units; (d) Silicones (heading 39.10); (e) Resols (heading 39.09) and other prepolymers. 4.- The expression "copolymers" covers all polymers in which no single monomer unit contributes 95 % or more by weight to the total polymer content. For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including copolycondensates, co-polyaddition products, block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this Note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together. If no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration. 5.- Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers. 6.- In headings 39.01 to 39.14, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms : (a) Liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions; (b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms. 7.- Heading No. 39.15 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 39.01 to 39.14). 8.- For the purposes of heading 39.17, the expression "tubes, pipes and hoses" means hollow products, whether semi-manufactures or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last-mentioned, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes. 9.- For the purposes of heading 39.18, the expression "wall or ceiling coverings of plastics" applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated. 10.-In headings 39.20 and 39-21, the expression "plates, sheets, film, foil and strip" applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use). 11-Heading No. 39.25 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of sub-Chapter II: (a) Reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 l; (b) Structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs; (c) Gutters and fittings therefor; (d) Doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors; (e) Balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers; (f) Shutters, blinds (including Venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof; (g) Large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses; (h) Ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and (ij) Fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates. Subheading Notes. 1.- Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions : (a) Where there is a subheading named "Other" in the same series : (1) The designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix "poly" (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content. (2) The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3903.20, 3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content. (3) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named "Other", provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading. (4) Polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared. (b) Where there is no subheading named "Other" in the same series : (1) Polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared. (2) Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. Polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions. 2.- For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term "plasticisers" includes secondary plasticisers.

###Chapter 40

###Rubber and articles thereof

Notes. 1.- Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout the Nomenclature the expression "rubber" means the following products, whether or not vulcanised or hard : natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed. 2.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles); (b) Footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64; (c) Headgear or parts thereof (including bathing caps) of Chapter 65; (d) Mechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof of Section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of hard rubber; (e) Articles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96; or (f) Articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens and mitts and articles of headings 40.11 to 40.13). 3.- In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms : (a) Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised, and other dispersions and solutions); (b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms. 4.- In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression "synthetic rubber" applies to : (a) Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18 °C and 29 °C, will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided for by Note 5 (B) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted; (b)Thioplasts (TM); and (c) Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and recovery in (a) above. 5.- (A) Headings Nos. 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with: (i) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex); (ii) pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification; (iii) plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), filters, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (B); (B) The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading 40.01 or 40.02, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material: (i) emulsifiers or anti-tack agents; (ii) small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers; (iii) very small amounts of the following; heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar special-purpose additives. 6.- For the purposes of heading 40.04, (he expression "waste, parings and scrap" means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other reasons. 7.- Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 40.08. 8.- Heading No. 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber. 9.- In headings 40.01, 40.02, 40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the expressions "plates", "sheets" and "strip" apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked. In heading 40.08 the expressions "rods" and "profile shapes" apply only to such products, whether or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.

For the purposes of this Note, the expression "textile garments" means garments of headings 61.01 to 61.14 and headings 62.01 to 62.11. Subheading Notes. 1.- In this Section and, where applicable, throughout the Nomenclature, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : (a) Unbleached yarn Yarn which : (i) has the natural colour of its constituent fibres and has not been bleached, dyed (whether or not in the mass) or printed; or (ii) is of indeterminate colour ("grey yarn"), manufactured from garnetted stock. Such yarn may have been treated with a colourless dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after simple washing with soap) and, in the case of man-made fibres, treated in the mass with delustring agents (for example, titanium dioxide). (b) Bleached yarn Yarn which : (i) has undergone a bleaching process, is made of bleached fibres or, unless the context otherwise requires, has been dyed white (whether or not in the mass) or treated with a white dressing; (ii) consists of a mixture of unbleached and bleached fibres; or (iii) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached and bleached yarns. (c) Coloured (dyed or printed) yarn Yarn which : (i) is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other than white or in a fugitive colour, or printed, or made from dyed or printed fibres; (ii) consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours or of a mixture of unbleached or bleached fibres with coloured fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots; (iii) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been printed; or (iv) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn. The above definitions also apply, *mutatis mutandis,* to monofilament and to strip or the like of Chapter 54. (d) Unbleached woven fabric Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not been bleached, dyed or printed. Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye. (e) Bleached woven fabric Woven fabric which: (i) has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated with a white dressing, in the piece, (ii) consists of bleached yarn; or (iii) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn. (f) Dyed woven fabric Woven fabric which : (i) is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless the context otherwise requires) or has been treated with a coloured finish other than white (unless the context otherwise requires), in the piece; or (ii) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour, (g) Woven fabric of yarns of different colours Woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which : (i) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of different shades of the same colour (other than the natural colour of the constituent fibres); (ii) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn; or (iii) consists of marl or mixture yarns. (In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into consideration.) (h)Printed woven fabric Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or not made from yarns of different colours. (The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.) The process of mercerisation does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics within the above categories. The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, *mutatis mutandis*, to knitted or crocheted fabrics. (ij) Plain weave A fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the weft. 2.- (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile material which would be selected under Note 2 to this Section for the classification of a product of Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 58.09 consisting of the same textile materials. (B) For the application of this rule : (a) where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under Interpretative Rule 3 shall be taken into account; (b) in the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface no account shall be taken of the ground fabric; (c) in the case of embroidery of heading 58.10 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However, embroidery without visible ground, and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering threads alone.

###Man-made filaments; strip and the like of man-made textile materials

Notes. 1.- Throughout the Nomenclature, the term "man-made fibres" means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either: (a) By polymerisation of organic monomers to produce polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins or polyurethanes, or by chemical modification of polymers produced by this process f(or example, poly(vinyl alcohol) prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)); or (b) By dissolution or chemical treatment of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers such as cuprammonium rayon (cupro) or viscose rayon, or by chemical modification of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein and other proteins, or alginic acid), to produce polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates. The terms ‘‘synthetic’’ and ‘‘artificial’’, used in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial: fibres as defined at (b). Strip and the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05 are not considered to be man-made fibres. The terms "man-made", "synthetic" and "artificial" shall have the same meanings when used in relation to "textile materials". 2.- Headings Nos. 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.

###Wadding, felt and nonwovens; special yarns; twine, cordage, ropes and cables and articles thereof

Notes. 1.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Wadding, felt or nonwovens, impregnated, coated or covered with substances or preparations (for example, perfumes or cosmetics of Chapter 33, soaps or detergents of heading 34.01, polishes, creams or similar preparations of heading 34.05, fabric softeners of heading 38.09) where the textile material is present merely as a carrying medium; (b)Textile products of heading 58.11; (c) Natural or artificial abrasive powder or grain, on a backing of felt or nonwovens (heading 68.05); (d) Agglomerated or reconstituted mica, on a backing of felt or nonwovens (heading 68.14); or (e) Metal foil on a backing of felt or nonwovens (generally Section XIV or XV). 2.- The term "felt" includes needleloom felt and fabrics consisting of a web of textile fibres the cohesion of which has been enhanced by a stitch-bonding process using fibres from the web itself. 3.- Headings Nos. 56.02 and 56.03 cover respectively felt and nonwovens, impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber whatever the nature of these materials (compact or cellular). Heading No. 56.03 also includes nonwovens in which plastics or rubber forms the bonding substance. Headings Nos. 56.02 and 56.03 do not, however, cover: (a) Felt impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with plastics or rubber, containing 50 % or less by weight of textile material or felt completely embedded in plastics or rubber (Chapter 39 or 40); (b) Nonwovens, either completely embedded in plastics or rubber, or entirely coated or covered on both sides with such materials, provided that such coating or covering can be seen with the naked eye with no account being taken of any resulting change of colour (Chapter 39 or 40); or (c) Plates, sheets or strip of cellular plastics or cellular rubber combined with felt or nonwovens, where the material is present merely for reinforcing purposes (Chapter 39 or 40). 4.- Heading No. 56.04 does not cover textile yarn, or strip or the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05, in which the impregnation, coating or covering cannot be seen with the naked eye (usually Chapters 50 to 55); for the purpose of this provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour.

###Chapter 74

###Copper and articles thereof

Note. 1.- In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them: (a) Refined copper Metal containing at least 99.85 % by weight of copper; or Metal containing at least 97.5 % by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table : TABLE - Other elements  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Element  | Limiting content % by weight  |
| Ag  | Sliver  | 0.25  |
| As  | Arsenic  | 0.5  |
| Cd  | Cadmium  | 1.3  |
| Cr  | Chromium  | 1.4  |
| Mg  | Magnesium  | 0.8  |
| Pb  | Lead  | 1.5  |
| S  | Sulphur  | 0.7  |
| Sn  | Tin  | 0.8  |
| Te  | Tellurium  | 0.8  |
| Zn  | Zinc  | 1  |
| Zr  | Zirconium  | 0.3  |
| Other elements*, each  | --- | 0.3  |

* Other element are, for example, Al, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si. (b) Copper alloys Metallic substances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that: (i) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or (ii) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 2.5 %. (c) Master alloys Alloys containing with other elements more than 10 % by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non- ferrous metals. However, copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15 % by weight of phosphorus falls in heading 28.48. (d) Bars and rods Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products, with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de- scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. Wire-bars and billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simply to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 74.03. (e) Profiles Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. (f) Wire Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) . Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. (g) Plates, sheets, strip and foil Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading 74.03) , coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including "modified rectangles" of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are: - of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width, - of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings. Headings Nos. 74.09 and 74.10 apply, *inter alia,* to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings. (h) Tubes and pipes Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross- section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be taken to be tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross- sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings. Subheading Note. 1.- In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : (a) Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses) Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present: - zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements; - any nickel content by weight is less than 5 % (see copper-nickel zinc alloys (nickel silvers) ); and - any tin content by weight is less than 3 % (see copper-tin alloys (bronzes) ). (b) Copper- tin base alloys (bronzes) Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 % or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10 %. (c) Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers) Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5 % or more by weight (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses) ). (d) Copper-nickel base alloys Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by weight not more than 1 % of zinc. When other elements are present, nickel predominates by weight over each of such other elements.

###Aluminium and articles thereof

Note. 1.- In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them : (a) Bars and rods Rolled, extruded, drawn or forged products, not in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de- scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. (b) Profiles Rolled, extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform cross-section along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings. (c) Wire Rolled, extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including "flattened circles" and "modified rectangles", of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal crosssection may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including "modified rectangular") cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. (d) Plates, sheets, strip and foil Flat-surfaced products (other than the unwrought products of heading 76.01), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including "modified rectangles" of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are : - of rectangular (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one-tenth of the width, - of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings. Heading No. 76.06 and 76.07 applies, *inter alia,* to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings. (e) Tubes and pipes Hollow products, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness. Products with a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross- section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be considered as tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing cross- sections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shaped or fitted with flanges, collars or rings. Subheading Notes. 1.- In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them: (a) Aluminium, not alloyed Metal containing by weight at least 99 % of aluminium, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table : TABLE - Other elements

###Chapter 85

###Electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles

Notes. 1.- This Chapter does not cover: (a) Electrically warmed blankets, bed pads, foot-muffs or the like; electrically warmed clothing, footwear or ear pads or other electrically warmed articles worn on or about the person; (b) Articles of glass of heading 70.11; (c) Machines and apparatus of heading 84.86; (d) Vacuum apparatus of a kind used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary purposes (Chapter 90); or (e) Electrically heated furniture of Chapter 94. 2.- Headings Nos. 85.01 to 85.04 do not apply to goods described in heading 85.11, 85.12, 85.40, 85.41 or 85.42. However, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers remain classified in heading 85.04. 3.- Heading No. 85.09 covers only the following electro-mechanical machines of the kind commonly used for domestic purposes : (a) Floor polishers, food grinders and mixers, and fruit or vegetable juice extractors, of any weight; (b) Other machines provided the weight of such machines does not exceed 20 Kg. The heading does not, however, apply to fans or ventilating or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether or not fitted with filters (heading 84.14), centrifugal clothes-dryers (heading 84.21), dish washing machines (heading 84.22), household washing machines (heading 84.50), roller or other ironing machines (heading 84.20 or 84.51), sewing machines (heading 84.52), electric scissors (heading 84.67) or to electro-thermic appliances (heading 85.16). 4. - For the purposes of heading 85.23: (a) ‘‘Solid-state non-volatile storage devices’’ (for example, ‘‘flash memory cards’’ or ‘‘flash electronic storage cards’’) are storage devices with a connecting socket, comprising in the same housing one or more flash memories (for example, ‘‘FLASH E <sup>2</sup> PROM’’) in the form of integrated circuits mounted on a printed circuit board. They may include a controller in the form of an integrated circuit and discrete passive components, such as capacitors and resistors; (b) The term ‘‘smart cards’’ means cards which have embedded in them one or more electronic integrated circuits (a microprocessor, random access memory (RAM) or read-only memory (ROM)) in the form of chips. These cards may contain contacts, a magnetic stripe or an embedded antenna but do not contain any other active or passive circuit elements. 5.- For the purposes of heading 85.34 "printed circuits" are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by the "film circuit" technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a pre-established pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements). The expression "printed circuits" does not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtained during the printing process, nor does it cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors or inductances. Printed circuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements. Thin- or thick-film circuits comprising passive and active elements obtained during the same technological process are to be classified in heading 85.42. 6. - For the purpose of heading 85.36, ‘‘connectors for optical fibres, optical fibre bundles or cables’’ means connectors that simply mechanically align optical fibres end to end in a digital line system. They perform no other function, such as the amplification, regeneration or modification of a signal. 7. - Heading 85.37 does not include cordless infrared devices for the remote control of television receivers or other electrical equipment (heading 85.43). 8. - For the purposes of headings 85.41 and 85.42: (a) ‘‘Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices’’ are semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistivity on the application of an electric field; (b) ‘‘Electronic integrated circuits’’ are: (i) Monolithic integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes, transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the surface of a semiconductor or compound semiconductor material (for example, doped silicon, gallium arsenide, silicon germanium, indium phosphide) and are inseparably associated; (ii) Hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.), obtained by thin or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, by interconnections or interconnecting cables, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.). These circuits may also include discrete components; (iii) Multichip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without leadframes, but with no other active or passive circuit elements. For the classification of the articles defined in this Note, headings 85.41 and 85.42 shall take precedence over any other heading in the Nomenclature, except in the case of heading 85.23, which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function. 9.- For the purposes of heading 85.48, "spent primary cells, spent primary batteries and spent electric accumulators" are those which are neither usable as such because of breakage, cutting-up, wear or other reasons, nor capable of being recharged. Subheading Note. 1.- Subheading 8527.12 covers only cassetteplayers with built-in amplifier, without built-in loudspeaker, capable of operating without an external source of electric power and the dimensions of which do not exceed 170 mm x 100 mm x 45 mm.

####Internationaal Verdrag betreffende het geharmoniseerde systeem inzake de omschrijving en de codering van goederen

Preambule De Partijen bij dit Verdrag, opgesteld onder auspiciën van de Internationale Douaneraad, Verlangende de internationale handel te vergemakkelijken, Verlangende het verzamelen, vergelijken en analyseren van statistieken, in het bijzonder die betreffende de buitenlandse handel, te vergemakkelijken, Verlangende de kosten te verminderen die worden gemaakt als gevolg van het opnieuw omschrijven, indelen en coderen van goederen wanneer die in het internationale handelsverkeer overgaan van het ene indelingssysteem naar het andere, alsmede de standaardisering van handelsdocumenten en de overdracht van gegevens te vergemakkelijken, Overwegende dat de ontwikkeling van de technologie en de veranderingen in de structuur van de internationale handel ingrijpende wijzigingen nodig maken in het Verdrag inzake de nomenclatuur voor de indeling van goederen in de douanetarieven, gedaan te Brussel op 15 december 1950, Tevens overwegende dat de mate van verbijzondering die door Regeringen en handelskringen voor douane- en statistiekdoeleinden wordt verlangd, thans veel groter is dan die welke is te vinden in de nomenclatuur, opgenomen in de bijlage bij bovengenoemd Verdrag, Overwegende dat het voor het voeren van internationale handelsbesprekingen van belang is om over nauwkeurige en vergelijkbare gegevens te beschikken, Overwegende dat het geharmoniseerde systeem is bedoeld om te worden gebruikt voor de vrachttarieven en de statistieken van de verschillende soorten goederenvervoer, Overwegende dat het geharmoniseerde systeem is bedoeld om in zo ruim mogelijke mate te worden opgenomen in commerciële systemen voor de omschrijving en de codering van goederen, Overwegende dat het geharmoniseerde systeem is bedoeld om de totstandkoming te bevorderen van een zo nauw mogelijke correlatie tussen de statistieken van de buitenlandse handel enerzijds, en de produktiestatistieken anderzijds, Overwegende dat een nauwe correlatie dient te worden gehandhaafd tussen het geharmoniseerde systeem en de „Type classificatie voor de internationale handel” van de Verenigde Naties, Overwegende dat het wenselijk is om te voldoen aan bovengenoemde behoeften door middel van een geïntegreerde nomenclatuur voor douane- en statistiekdoeleinden die kan worden gebruikt door de verschillende belanghebbenden bij de internationale handel, Overwegende dat het van belang is te verzekeren dat het geharmoniseerde systeem gelijke tred houdt met de ontwikkeling van de technologie en met de veranderingen in de structuur van de internationale handel, Kennis genomen hebbende van het werk dat op dit gebied is verricht door het Comité voor het Geharmoniseerde Systeem, dat door de Internationale Douaneraad is ingesteld, Overwegende dat, hoewel het bovengenoemde Verdrag inzake de nomenclatuur een doeltreffend middel is gebleken voor het bereiken van sommige van deze doelstellingen, het sluiten van een nieuw internationaal verdrag de beste wijze is om tot de gewenste resultaten te komen, Zijn als volgt overeengekomen:

####Verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Partijen

1.  Behoudens de uitzonderingen, genoemd in artikel 4: 

a. verbindt elke Verdragsluitende Partij zich om, onder voorbehoud van het bepaalde in letter c van dit lid, vanaf de datum waarop dit Verdrag met betrekking tot deze Partij in werking treedt, haar tariefnomenclatuur en haar statistieknomenclaturen in overeenstemming te doen zijn met het geharmoniseerde systeem. Zij verbindt zich aldus om, met betrekking tot haar tariefnomenclatuur en haar statistieknomenclaturen: 

1°. alle posten en onderverdelingen van het geharmoniseerde systeem zonder enige toevoeging of wijziging, alsmede de daarop betrekking hebbende numerieke codes te gebruiken;  

2°. de algemene regels voor de interpretatie van het geharmoniseerde systeem, alsmede alle aantekeningen op de afdelingen en de hoofdstukken en de aanvullende aantekeningen op de onderverdelingen toe te passen en de draagwijdte van de afdelingen, hoofdstukken, posten of onderverdelingen van het geharmoniseerde systeem niet te wijzigen;

### Artikel  4  

####Gedeeltelijke toepassing door ontwikkelingslanden

1.  Elk ontwikkelingsland dat Verdragsluitende Partij is, kan de toepassing van sommige of van alle onderverdelingen van de posten van het geharmoniseerde systeem uitstellen gedurende de periode die, rekening houdend met de structuur van zijn internationale handel of met zijn bestuurlijke mogelijkheden, noodzakelijk is.   
2.  Een ontwikkelingsland dat Verdragsluitende Partij is en het geharmoniseerde systeem overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel gedeeltelijk wenst toe te passen, verbindt zich ertoe alles in het werk te stellen om het volledige geharmoniseerde systeem met zes-cijfercode toe te passen binnen vijf jaar, te rekenen van de datum waarop dit Verdrag met betrekking tot dit land in werking treedt, of binnen een ander door dit land eventueel noodzakelijk geacht tijdvak, gelet op het bepaalde in het eerste lid van dit artikel.   
3.  Een ontwikkelingsland dat Verdragsluitende Partij is en het geharmoniseerde systeem overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel gedeeltelijk wenst toe te passen, past alle of geen van de onderverdelingen met twee streepjes toe van een willekeurige onderverdeling met één streepje, dan wel alle of geen van de onderverdelingen met één streepje van een willekeurige post. In dergelijke gevallen van gedeeltelijke toepassing wordt het zesde cijfer of worden het vijfde en zesde cijfer van het gedeelte van de code van het geharmoniseerde systeem dat niet wordt toegepast, onderscheidenlijk door „0” of „00” vervangen.   
4.  Een ontwikkelingsland dat het geharmoniseerde systeem overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel gedeeltelijk wenst toe te passen, stelt, wanneer het Verdragsluitende Partij wordt, de Secretaris-Generaal ervan in kennis welke onderverdelingen het niet zal toepassen op de datum waarop dit Verdrag met betrekking tot dit land in werking treedt, en stelt de Secretaris-Generaal er tevens van in kennis welke onderverdelingen het nadien toepast.   
5.  Elk ontwikkelingsland dat het geharmoniseerde systeem overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel gedeeltelijk wenst toe te passen, kan, wanneer het Verdragsluitende Partij wordt, de Secretaris-Generaal mededelen dat het zich formeel verbindt het volledige geharmoniseerde systeem met zes-cijfercode toe te passen binnen drie jaar, te rekenen van de datum waarop dit Verdrag met betrekking tot dat land in werking treedt.   
6.  Elk ontwikkelingsland dat Verdragsluitende Partij is en het geharmoniseerde systeem overeenkomstig het bepaalde in dit artikel gedeeltelijk toepast, wordt van zijn verplichtingen die voortvloeien uit artikel 3 ontheven met betrekking tot de onderverdelingen die het niet toepast.
