(d).  If a renewal survey has been completed and a new certificate cannot be issued or placed on board the ship before the expiry date of the existing certificate, the person or organization authorized by the Administration may endorse the existing certificate and such a certificate shall be accepted as valid for a further period which shall not exceed 5 months from the expiry date.   
(e).  If a ship at the time when a certificate expires is not in a port in which it is to be surveyed, the Administration may extend the period of validity of the certificate but this extension shall be granted only for the purpose of allowing the ship to complete its voyage to the port in which it is to be surveyed, and then only in cases where it appears proper and reasonable to do so. No certificate shall be extended for a period longer than three months, and a ship to which an extension is granted shall not, on its arrival in the port in which it is to be surveyed, be entitled by virtue of such extension to leave that port without having a new certificate. When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to: 

(i) for a passenger ship, a date not exceeding twelve months from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted;  

(ii) for a cargo ship, a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.     
(f).  A certificate issued to a ship engaged on short voyages which has not been extended under the foregoing provisions of this regulation may be extended by the Administration for a period of grace of up to one month from the date of expiry stated on it. When the renewal survey is completed, the new certificate shall be valid to: 

(i) for a passenger ship, a date not exceeding twelve months from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted;  

(ii) for a cargo ship, a date not exceeding five years from the date of expiry of the existing certificate before the extension was granted.     
(g).  In special circumstances, as determined by the Administration, a new certificate need not be dated from the date of expiry of the existing certificate as required by paragraphs b)(ii), e) or f). In these special circumstances, the new certificate shall be valid to: 

(i) for a passenger ship, a date not exceeding twelve months from the date of completion of the renewal survey;  

(ii) for a cargo ship, a date not exceeding five years from the date of completion of the renewal survey.     
(h).  If an annual, intermediate or periodical survey is completed before the period specified in the relevant regulations then: 

(i) the anniversary date shown on the relevant certificate shall be amended by endorsement to a date which shall not be more than three months later than the date on which the survey was completed;  

(ii) the subsequent annual, intermediate or periodical survey required by the relevant regulations shall be completed at the intervals prescribed by these regulations using the new anniversary date;  

(iii) the expiry date may remain unchanged provided one or more annual, intermediate or periodical surveys, as appropriate, are carried out so that the maximum intervals between the surveys prescribed by the relevant regulations are not exceeded.     
(i).  A certificate issued under regulation 12 or 13 shall cease to be valid in any of the following cases: 

(i) if the relevant surveys and inspections are not completed within the periods specified under regulations 7a), 8a), 9a) and 10a);  

(ii) if the certificate is not endorsed in accordance with the present regulations;  

(iii) upon transfer of the ship to the flag of another State. A new certificate shall only be issued when the Government issuing the new certificate is fully satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the requirements of regulation 11a) and b). In the case of a transfer between Contracting Governments, if requested within three months after the transfer has taken place, the Government of the State whose flag the ship was formerly entitled to fly shall, as soon as possible, transmit to the Administration copies of the certificates carried by the ship before the transfer and, if available, copies of the relevant survey reports.

### Regulation  19  

####Control

a).  Every ship when in a port of another Contracting Government is subject to control by officers duly authorized by such Government in so far as this control is directed towards verifying that the certificates issued under regulation 12 or regulation 13 are valid.   
b).  Such certificates, if valid, shall be accepted unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of any of the certificates or that the ship and its equipment are not in compliance with the provisions of regulation 11a) and b).   
c).  In the circumstances given in paragraph b) or where a certificate has expired or ceased to be valid, the officer carrying out the control shall take steps to ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea or leave the port for the purpose of proceeding to the appropriate repair yard without danger to the ship or persons on board.   
d).  In the event of this control giving rise to an intervention of any kind, the officer carrying out the control shall forthwith inform, in writing, the Consul or, in his absence, the nearest diplomatic representative of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly of all the circumstances in which intervention was deemed necessary. In addition, nominated surveyors or recognized organizations responsible for the issue of the certificates shall also be notified. The facts concerning the intervention shall be reported to the Organization.   
e).  The port State authority concerned shall notify all relevant information about the ship to the authorities of the next port of call, in addition to parties mentioned in paragraph d), if it is unable to take action as specified in paragraphs c) and d) or if the ship has been allowed to proceed to the next port of call.   
f).  When exercising control under this regulation all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. If a ship is thereby unduly detained or delayed it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered.

No reports or recommendations of the Organization based upon such information shall disclose the identity or nationality of the ships concerned or in any manner fix or imply responsibility upon any ship or person.   

### CHAPTER  II-1  

####CONSTRUCTION – STRUCTURE, SUBDIVISION AND STABILITY, MACHINERY AND ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

### PART  A  

####GENERAL

### Regulation  1  

####Application

1.1.  Unless expressly provided otherwise, this chapter shall apply to ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 January 2009.   
1.2.  For the purpose of this chapter, the term a *similar stage of construction* means the stage at which: 

.1. construction identifiable with a specific ship begins; and  

.2. assembly of that ship has commenced comprising at least 50 tonnes or one per cent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.     
1.3.  For the purpose of this chapter: 

.1. the expression *ships constructed* means ships the keels of which are laid or which are at a similar stage of construction;  

.2. the expression *all ships* means ships constructed before, on or after 1 January 2009;  

.3. a cargo ship, whenever built, which is converted to a passenger ship shall be treated as a passenger ship constructed on the date on which such a conversion commences;  

.4. the expression *alterations and modifications of a major character* means, in the context of cargo ship subdivision and stability, any modification to the construction which affects the level of subdivision of that ship. Where a cargo ship is subject to such modification, it shall be demonstrated that the *A* / *R* ratio calculated for the ship after such modifications is not less than the *A* / *R* ratio calculated for the ship before the modification.   However, in those cases where the ship’s *A* / *R* ratio before modification is equal to or greater than unity, it is only necessary that the ship after modification has an *A* value which is not less than *R*, calculated for the modified ship.   
2.  Unless expressly provided otherwise, for ships constructed before 1 January 2009, the Administration shall ensure that the requirements which are applicable under chapter II-1 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended by resolutions MSC.1(XLV), MSC.6(48), MSC.11(55), MSC.12(56), MSC.13(57), MSC.19(58), MSC.26(60), MSC.27(61), Resolution 1 of the 1995 SOLAS Conference, MSC.47(66), MSC.57(67), MSC.65(68), MSC.69(69), MSC.99(73), MSC.134(76), MSC.151(78) and MSC.170(79) are complied with.   
3.  All ships which undergo repairs, alterations, modifications and outfitting related thereto shall continue to comply with at least the requirements previously applicable to these ships. Such ships, if constructed before the date on which any relevant amendments enter into force, shall, as a rule, comply with the requirements for ships constructed on or after that date to at least the same extent as they did before undergoing such repairs, alterations, modifications or outfitting. Repairs, alterations and modifications of a major character and outfitting related thereto shall meet the requirements for ships constructed on or after the date on which any relevant amendments enter into force, in so far as the Administration deems reasonable and practicable.   
4.  The Administration of a State may, if it considers that the sheltered nature and conditions of the voyage are such as to render the application of any specific requirements of this chapter unreasonable or unnecessary, exempt from those requirements individual ships or classes of ships entitled to fly the flag of that State which, in the course of their voyage, do not proceed more than 20 miles from the nearest land.   
5.  In the case of passenger ships which are employed in special trades for the carriage of large numbers of special trade passengers, such as the pilgrim trade, the Administration of the State whose flag such ships are entitled to fly, if satisfied that it is impracticable to enforce compliance with the requirements of this chapter, may exempt such ships from those requirements, provided that they comply fully with the provisions of: 

.1. the rules annexed to the Special Trade Passenger Ships Agreement, 1971; and  

.2. the rules annexed to the Protocol on Space Requirements for Special Trade Passenger Ships, 1973.

### PART  B  

####SUBDIVISION AND STABILITY

### Regulation  4  

####General

1.  The damage stability requirements in parts B-1 through B-4 shall apply to cargo ships of 80 m in length (*L*) and upwards and to all passenger ships regardless of length but shall exclude those cargo ships which are shown to comply with subdivision and damage stability regulations in other instruments developed by the Organization. <sup> 1)  Cargo ships shown to comply with the following regulations may be excluded from the application of part B-1:    .1.  Annex I to MARPOL 73/78, except OBO ships with type B freeboards are not excluded;    .2.  International Bulk Chemical Code;    .3.  International Gas Carrier Code;    .4.  Guidelines for the design and construction of offshore supply vessels (resolution A.469(XII));    .5.  Code of Safety for Special Purpose Ships (resolution A.534(13), as amended);    .6.  Damage stability requirements of regulation 27 of the 1966 Load Lines Convention as applied in compliance with resolutions A.320(IX) and A.514(13), provided that in the case of cargo ships to which regulation 27(9) applies, main transverse watertight bulkheads, to be considered effective, are spaced according to paragraph (12)(f) of resolution A.320(IX), except ships intended for the carriage of deck cargo; and    .7.  Damage stability requirements of regulation 27 of the 1988 Load Lines Protocol, except ships intended for the carriage of deck cargo.    </sup>   
2.  The Administration may, for a particular ship or group of ships, accept alternative methodologies if it is satisfied that at least the same degree of safety as represented by these regulations is achieved. Any Administration which allows such alternative methodologies shall communicate to the Organization particulars thereof.   
3.  Ships shall be as efficiently subdivided as is possible having regard to the nature of the service for which they are intended. The degree of subdivision shall vary with the subdivision length (*L <sub>s</sub>*) of the ship and with the service, in such manner that the highest degree of subdivision corresponds with the ships of greatest subdivision length (*L <sub>s</sub>*), primarily engaged in the carriage of passengers.   
4.  Where it is proposed to fit decks, inner skins or longitudinal bulkheads of sufficient tightness to seriously restrict the flow of water, the Administration shall be satisfied that proper consideration is given to beneficial or adverse effects of such structures in the calculations.   

### PART  B-1  

####STABILITY

### Regulation  5  

####Intact stability

<sup> 2)  Refer to the Code on Intact Stability for All Types of Ships covered by IMO Instruments, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.749(18).  </sup>   
1.  Every passenger ship regardless of size and every cargo ship having a length (*L*) of 24 m and upwards, shall be inclined upon its completion and the elements of its stability determined. In addition to any other applicable requirements of the present regulations, ships having a length of 24 m and upwards constructed on or after 1 July 2010 shall as a minimum comply with the requirements of part A of the 2008 IS Code.   
2.  The Administration may allow the inclining test of an individual cargo ship to be dispensed with provided basic stability data are available from the inclining test of a sister ship and it is shown to the satisfaction of the Administration that reliable stability information for the exempted ship can be obtained from such basic data, as required by regulation 5-1. A weight survey shall be carried out upon completion and the ship shall be inclined whenever in comparison with the data derived from the sister ship, a deviation from the lightship displacement exceeding 1% for ships of 160 m or more in length and 2% for ships of 50 m or less in length and as determined by linear interpolation for intermediate lengths or a deviation from the lightship longitudinal centre of gravity exceeding 0.5% of *L <sub>s</sub>* is found.   
3.  The Administration may also allow the inclining test of an individual ship or class of ships especially designed for the carriage of liquids or ore in bulk to be dispensed with when reference to existing data for similar ships clearly indicates that due to the ship’s proportions and arrangements more than sufficient metacentric height will be available in all probable loading conditions.   
4.  Where any alterations are made to a ship so as to materially affect the stability information supplied to the master, amended stability information shall be provided. If necessary the ship shall be re-inclined. The ship shall be re-inclined if anticipated deviations exceed one of the values specified in paragraph 5.   
5.  At periodical intervals not exceeding five years, a lightweight survey shall be carried out on all passenger ships to verify any changes in lightship displacement and longitudinal centre of gravity. The ship shall be re-inclined whenever, in comparison with the approved stability information, a deviation from the lightship displacement exceeding 2% or a deviation of the longitudinal centre of gravity exceeding 1% of *L <sub>s</sub>* is found or anticipated.   
6.  Every ship shall have scales of draughts marked clearly at the bow and stern. In the case where the draught marks are not located where they are easily readable, or operational constraints for a particular trade make it difficult to read the draught marks, then the ship shall also be fitted with a reliable draught indicating system by which the bow and stern draughts can be determined.   

### Regulation  5-1  

####Stability information to be supplied to the master

<sup> 3)  Refer also to the Guidelines for the preparation of intact stability information (MSC/Circ.456);   Guidance on the intact stability of existing tankers during transfer operations (MSC/Circ.706); and the Revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in following and quartering seas (MSC.1/Circ.1228).  </sup>   
1.  The master shall be supplied with such information satisfactory to the Administration as is necessary to enable him by rapid and simple processes to obtain accurate guidance as to the stability of the ship under varying conditions of service. A copy of the stability information shall be furnished to the Administration.   
2.  The information should include: 

.1. curves or tables of minimum operational metacentric height (*GM*) versus draught which assures compliance with the relevant intact and damage stability requirements, alternatively corresponding curves or tables of the maximum allowable vertical centre of gravity (*KG*) versus draught, or with the equivalents of either of these curves;  

.2. instructions concerning the operation of cross-flooding arrangements; and  

.3. all other data and aids which might be necessary to maintain the required intact stability and stability after damage.     
3.  The stability information shall show the influence of various trims in cases where the operational trim range exceeds +/- 0.5% of *L <sub>s</sub>*.   
4.  For ships which have to fulfil the stability requirements of part B-1, information referred to in paragraph 2 are determined from considerations related to the subdivision index, in the following manner: Minimum required *GM* (or maximum permissible vertical position of centre of gravity *KG*) for the three draughts *d <sub>s</sub>*, *d <sub>p</sub>* and *d <sub>l</sub>* are equal to the *GM* (or *KG* values) of corresponding loading cases used for the calculation of survival factor *s <sub>i</sub>*. For intermediate draughts, values to be used shall be obtained by linear interpolation applied to the *GM* value only between the deepest subdivision draught and the partial subdivision draught and between the partial load line and the light service draught respectively. Intact stability criteria will also be taken into account by retaining for each draft the maximum among minimum required *GM* values or the minimum of maximum permissible *KG* values for both criteria. If the subdivision index is calculated for different trims, several required *GM* curves will be established in the same way.   
5.  When curves or tables of minimum operational metacentric height (*GM*) versus draught are not appropriate, the master should ensure that the operating condition does not deviate from a studied loading condition, or verify by calculation that the stability criteria are satisfied for this loading condition.   

### Regulation  6  

####Required subdivision index R

<sup> 4)  The Maritime Safety Committee, in adopting the regulations contained in parts B to B-4, invited Administrations to note that the regulations should be applied in conjunction with the explanatory notes developed by the Organization in order to ensure their uniform application.  </sup>   
1.  The subdivision of a ship is considered sufficient if the attained subdivision index *A*, determined in accordance with regulation 7, is not less than the required subdivision index *R* calculated in accordance with this regulation and if, in addition, the partial indices *A*<sub>s</sub>, *A*<sub>p</sub> and *A*<sub>l</sub> are not less than 0.9 *R* for passenger ships and 0.5 *R* for cargo ships.   
2.  For all ships to which the damage stability requirements of this chapter apply, the degree of subdivision to be provided shall be determined by the required subdivision index *R*, as follows: 

.1. In the case of cargo ships greater than 100 m in length (*L <sub>s</sub>*):   ![10000053191](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053191)

.2. In the case of cargo ships not less than 80 m in length (*L <sub>s</sub>*) and not greater than 100 m in length (*L <sub>s</sub>*):   ![10000053192](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053192)
where *R <sub>o</sub>* is the value *R* as calculated in accordance with the formula in subparagraph .1.  

.3. In the case of passenger ships:   ![10000053193](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053193)
where: *N* = *N*<sub>1</sub> + 2 *N*<sub>2</sub> *N*<sub>1</sub> = number of persons for whom lifeboats are provided *N*<sub>2</sub> = number of persons (including officers and crew) the ship is permitted to carry in excess of *N*<sub>1</sub>.  

.4. Where the conditions of service are such that compliance with paragraph 2.3 of this regulation on the basis of *N* = *N*<sub>1</sub> + 2 *N*<sub>2</sub> is impracticable and where the Administration considers that a suitably reduced degree of hazard exists, a lesser value of *N* may be taken but in no case less than *N* = *N*<sub>1</sub> + *N*<sub>2</sub>.     

### Regulation  7  

####Attained subdivision index A

1.  The attained subdivision index *A* is obtained by the summation of the partial indices *A*<sub>s</sub>, *A*<sub>p</sub> and *A*<sub>l</sub>, (weighted as shown) calculated for the draughts *d*<sub>s</sub>, *d*<sub>p</sub> and *d*<sub>l</sub> defined in regulation 2 in accordance with the following formula: *A* = 0.4 *A <sub>s</sub>* + 0.4 *A <sub>p</sub>* + 0.2 *A <sub>l</sub>* Each partial index is a summation of contributions from all damage cases taken in consideration, using the following formula: *A* = Σ *p <sub>i</sub>**s <sub>i</sub>* where: *i* represents each compartment or group of compartments under consideration, *p <sub>i</sub>* accounts for the probability that only the compartment or group of compartments under consideration may be flooded, disregarding any horizontal subdivision, as defined in regulation 7-1, *s <sub>i</sub>* accounts for the probability of survival after flooding the compartment or group of compartments under consideration, and includes the effect of any horizontal subdivision, as defined in regulation 7-2.   
2.  In the calculation of *A*, the level trim shall be used for the deepest subdivision draught and the partial subdivision draught. The actual service trim shall be used for the light service draught. If in any service condition, the trim variation in comparison with the calculated trim is greater than 0.5% of *L*<sub>s</sub>, one or more additional calculations of *A* are to be submitted for the same draughts but different trims so that, for all service conditions, the difference in trim in comparison with the reference trim used for one calculation will be less than 0.5% of *L*<sub>s</sub>.   
3.  When determining the positive righting lever (*GZ*) of the residual stability curve, the displacement used should be that of the intact condition. That is, the constant displacement method of calculation should be used.   
4.  The summation indicated by the above formula shall be taken over the ship’s subdivision length (*L*<sub>s</sub>) for all cases of flooding in which a single compartment or two or more adjacent compartments are involved. In the case of unsymmetrical arrangements, the calculated *A* value should be the mean value obtained from calculations involving both sides. Alternatively, it should be taken as that corresponding to the side which evidently gives the least favourable result.   
5.  Wherever wing compartments are fitted, contribution to the summation indicated by the formula shall be taken for all cases of flooding in which wing compartments are involved. Additionally, cases of simultaneous flooding of a wing compartment or group of compartments and the adjacent inboard compartment or group of compartments, but excluding damage of transverse extent greater than one half of the ship breadth *B*, may be added. For the purpose of this regulation, transverse extent is measured inboard from ship’s side, at right angle to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught.   
6.  In the flooding calculations carried out according to the regulations, only one breach of the hull and only one free surface need to be assumed. The assumed vertical extent of damage is to extend from the baseline upwards to any watertight horizontal subdivision above the waterline or higher. However, if a lesser extent of damage will give a more severe result, such extent is to be assumed.   
7.  If pipes, ducts or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage, arrangements are to be made to ensure that progressive flooding cannot thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed flooded. However, the Administration may permit minor progressive flooding if it is demonstrated that its effects can be easily controlled and the safety of the ship is not impaired.

####Calculation of the factor p <sub>i</sub>

1.  The factor *p <sub>i</sub>* for a compartment or group of compartments shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 using the following notations: *j* = the aftmost damage zone number involved in the damage starting with No.1 at the stern; *n* = the number of adjacent damage zones involved in the damage; *k* = is the number of a particular longitudinal bulkhead as barrier for transverse penetration in a damage zone counted from shell towards the centre line. The shell has *k* = 0; *x1* = the distance from the aft terminal of *L <sub>s</sub>* to the aft end of the zone in question; *x2* = the distance from the aft terminal of *L <sub>s</sub>* to the forward end of the zone in question; *b* = the mean transverse distance in metres measured at right angles to the centreline at the deepest subdivision loadline between the shell and an assumed vertical plane extended between the longitudinal limits used in calculating the factor *p <sub>i</sub>* and which is a tangent to, or common with, all or part of the outermost portion of the longitudinal bulkhead under consideration. This vertical plane shall be so orientated that the mean transverse distance to the shell is a maximum, but not more than twice the least distance between the plane and the shell. If the upper part of a longitudinal bulkhead is below the deepest subdivision loadline the vertical plane used for determination of *b* is assumed to extend upwards to the deepest subdivision waterline. In any case, *b* is not to be taken greater than *B* /2. If the damage involves a single zone only:   ![10000053233](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053233)

### Regulation  7-2  

####Calculation of the factor s <sub>i</sub>

1.  The factor *s <sub>i</sub>* shall be determined for each case of assumed flooding, involving a compartment or group of compartments, in accordance with the following notations and the provisions in this regulation. θ <sub>e</sub> is the equilibrium heel angle in any stage of flooding, in degrees; θ <sub>v</sub> is the angle, in any stage of flooding, where the righting lever becomes negative, or the angle at which an opening incapable of being closed weathertight becomes submerged; *GZ*<sub>max</sub> is the maximum positive righting lever, in metres, up to the angle θ <sub>v</sub>; *Range* is the range of positive righting levers, in degrees, measured from the angle θ <sub>e</sub>. The positive range is to be taken up to the angle θ <sub>v</sub>; *Flooding stage* is any discrete step during the flooding process, including the stage before equalization (if any) until final equilibrium has been reached. 

1.1. The factor *s <sub>i</sub>*, for any damage case at any initial loading condition, *d <sub>i</sub>*, shall be obtained from the formula:   ![10000053254](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053254)
where: *s*<sub>intermediate,i</sub> is the probability to survive all intermediate flooding stages until the final equilibrium stage, and is calculated in accordance with paragraph 2; *s*<sub>final,i</sub> is the probability to survive in the final equilibrium stage of flooding. It is calculated in accordance with paragraph 3; *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> is the probability to survive heeling moments, and is calculated in accordance with paragraph 4.     
2.  The factor s <sub>intermediate,i</sub> is applicable only to passenger ships (for cargo ships s <sub>intermediate,i</sub> should be taken as unity) and shall be taken as the least of the s-factors obtained from all flooding stages including the stage before equalization, if any, and is to be calculated as follows:   ![10000053255](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053255)
where *GZ*<sub>max</sub> is not to be taken as more than 0.05 m and *Range* as not more than 7°. *s*<sub>intermediate</sub> = 0, if the intermediate heel angle exceeds 15º. Where cross-flooding fittings are required, the time for equalization shall not exceed 10 min.   
3.  The factor *s*<sub>final,i</sub> shall be obtained from the formula:   ![10000053256](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053256)
where: *GZ*<sub>max</sub> is not to be taken as more than 0.12 m; *Range* is not to be taken as more than 16°;   ![10000053257](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053257)
where: θ <sub>min</sub> is 7° for passenger ships and 25° for cargo ships; and θ <sub>max</sub> is 15° for passenger ships and 30° for cargo ships.   
4.  The factor *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> is applicable only to passenger ships (for cargo ships *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> shall be taken as unity) and shall be calculated at the final equilibrium from the formula:   ![10000053258](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053258)
where: *Displacement* is the intact displacement at the subdivision draught; *M*<sub>heel</sub> is the maximum assumed heeling moment as calculated in accordance with subparagraph 4.1; and   ![10000053259](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053259)

4.1. The heeling moment *M*<sub>heel</sub> is to be calculated as follows:     ![10000053260](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053260)

4.1.1 *M*<sub>passenger</sub> is the maximum assumed heeling moment resulting from movement of passengers, and is to be obtained as follows: *M*<sub>passenger</sub> = (0.075 · *N*<sub>p</sub>) · (0.45 · *B*) (tm) where: *N <sub>p</sub>* is the maximum number of passengers permitted to be on board in the service condition corresponding to the deepest subdivision draught under consideration; and *B* is the beam of the ship. Alternatively, the heeling moment may be calculated assuming the passengers are distributed with 4 persons per square metre on available deck areas towards one side of the ship on the decks where muster stations are located and in such a way that they produce the most adverse heeling moment. In doing so, a weight of 75 kg per passenger is to be assumed.  

4.1.2. *M*<sub>wind</sub> is the maximum assumed wind force acting in a damage situation: *M*<sub>wind</sub> = (*P* · *A* · *Z*) / 9,806 (tm) where: *P* = 120 N/m <sup>2</sup>; *A* = projected lateral area above waterline; *Z* = distance from centre of lateral projected area above waterline to *T* /2; and *T* = ship’s draught, *d <sub>i</sub>*.  

4.1.3. *M*<sub>Survivalcraft</sub> is the maximum assumed heeling moment due to the launching of all fully loaded davit-launched survival craft on one side of the ship. It shall be calculated using the following assumptions: 

.1. all lifeboats and rescue boats fitted on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out fully loaded and ready for lowering;  

.2. for lifeboats which are arranged to be launched fully loaded from the stowed position, the maximum heeling moment during launching shall be taken;  

.3. a fully loaded davit-launched liferaft attached to each davit on the side to which the ship has heeled after having sustained damage shall be assumed to be swung out ready for lowering;  

.4. persons not in the life-saving appliances which are swung out shall not provide either additional heeling or righting moment; and  

.5. life-saving appliances on the side of the ship opposite to the side to which the ship has heeled shall be assumed to be in a stowed position.       
5.  Unsymmetrical flooding is to be kept to a minimum consistent with the efficient arrangements. Where it is necessary to correct large angles of heel, the means adopted shall, where practicable, be self-acting, but in any case where controls to equalization devices are provided they shall be operable from above the bulkhead deck. These fittings together with their controls shall be acceptable to the Administration. Suitable information concerning the use of equalization devices shall be supplied to the master of the ship. <sup> 5)  Reference is made to the Recommendation on a standard method for establishing compliance with the requirements for cross-flooding arrangements in passengers ships, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.266(VIII), as may be amended.  </sup>   
5.1.  Tanks and compartments taking part in such equalization shall be fitted with air pipes or equivalent means of sufficient cross-section to ensure that the flow of water into the equalization compartments is not delayed.   
5.2.  In all cases, *s*<sub>i</sub> is to be taken as zero in those cases where the final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, immerses: 

.1. the lower edge of openings through which progressive flooding may take place and such flooding is not accounted for in the calculation of factor *s*<sub>i</sub>. Such openings shall include air-pipes, ventilators and openings which are closed by means of weathertight doors or hatch covers; and  

.2. any part of the bulkhead deck in passenger ships considered a horizontal evacuation route for compliance with chapter II-2.     
5.3.  The factor *s*<sub>i</sub> is to be taken as zero if, taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, any of the following occur in any intermediate stage or in the final stage of flooding: 

.1. immersion of any vertical escape hatch in the bulkhead deck intended for compliance with chapter II-2;  

.2. any controls intended for the operation of watertight doors, equalization devices, valves on piping or on ventilation ducts intended to maintain the integrity of watertight bulkheads from above the bulkhead deck become inaccessible or inoperable;  

.3. immersion of any part of piping or ventilation ducts carried through a watertight boundary that is located within any compartment included in damage cases contributing to the attained index *A*, if not fitted with watertight means of closure at each boundary.     
5.4.  However, where compartments assumed flooded due to progressive flooding are taken into account in the damage stability calculations multiple values of *s*<sub>intermediate,i</sub> may be calculated assuming equalization in additional flooding phases.   
5.5.  Except as provided in paragraph 5.3.1, openings closed by means of watertight manhole covers and flush scuttles, small watertight hatch covers, remotely operated sliding watertight doors, side scuttles of the non-opening type as well as watertight access doors and hatch covers required to be kept closed at sea need not be considered.   
6.  Where horizontal watertight boundaries are fitted above the waterline under consideration the s-value calculated for the lower compartment or group of compartments shall be obtained by multiplying the value as determined in paragraph 1.1 by the reduction factor *v*<sub>m</sub> according to paragraph 6.1, which represents the probability that the spaces above the horizontal subdivision will not be flooded. 

6.1. The factor *v <sub>m</sub>* shall be obtained from the formula: *v <sub>m</sub>* = *v* (*H <sub>j, n, m,</sub> d*) – *v* (*H <sub>j, n, m</sub>*<sub>-1,</sub>*d*) where: *H <sub>j, n, m</sub>* is the least height above the baseline, in metres, within the longitudinal range of *x <sub>1</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub> … *x <sub>2</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub> of the *m*<sup>th</sup> horizontal boundary which is assumed to limit the vertical extent of flooding for the damaged compartments under consideration; *H <sub>j, n, m</sub>*<sub>-1</sub> is the least height above the baseline, in metres, within the longitudinal range of *x <sub>1</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub> … *x <sub>2</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub> of the (*m* -1) <sup>th</sup> horizontal boundary which is assumed to limit the vertical extent of flooding for the damaged compartments under consideration; *j* signifies the aft terminal of the damaged compartments under consideration; *m* represents each horizontal boundary counted upwards from the waterline under consideration; *d* is the draught in question as defined in regulation 2; and *x <sub>1</sub>* and *x <sub>2</sub>* represent the terminals of the compartment or group of compartments considered in regulation 7-1. 

6.1.1. The factors *v* (*H <sub>j, n, m,</sub> d*) and *v* (*H <sub>j, n, m</sub>*<sub>-1</sub>, d) shall be obtained from the formulae:   ![10000053261](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053261)
![10000053262](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053262)
where: *v* (*H <sub>j, n, m,</sub> d*) is to be taken as 1, if *H <sub>m</sub>* coincides with the uppermost watertight boundary of the ship within the range (*x* 1 <sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub> … *x* 2 <sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub>), and *v* (*H <sub>j, n, 0,</sub> d*) is to be taken as 0. In no case is *v <sub>m</sub>* to be taken as less than zero or more than 1.  

6.2. In general, each contribution *dA* to the index *A* in the case of horizontal subdivisions is obtained from the formula:   ![10000053263](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053263)
where: *v <sub>m</sub>* = the *v* -value calculated in accordance with paragraph 6.1; *s*<sub>min</sub> = the least *s* -factor for all combinations of damages obtained when the assumed damage extends from the assumed damage height *H <sub>m</sub>* downwards.     

### Regulation  7-3  

####Permeability

1.  For the purpose of the subdivision and damage stability calculations of the regulations, the permeability of each general compartment or part of a compartment shall be as follows:  

| Spaces  | Permeability  |
|:---|:---|
| Appropriated to stores  Occupied by accommodation  Occupied by machinery  Void spaces  Intended for liquids  | 0.60  0.95  0.85  0.95  0 or 0.95 <sup>1)</sup>  |

<sup>1)</sup> Whichever results in the more severe requirement.   
2.  For the purpose of the subdivision and damage stability calculations of the regulations, the permeability of each cargo compartment or part of a compartment shall be as follows:  

| Spaces  | Permeability at draught *d <sub>s</sub>*  | Permeability at draught *d <sub>p</sub>*  | Permeability at draught *d <sub>l</sub>*  |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Dry cargo spaces  Container spaces  Ro-ro spaces  Cargo liquids  | 0.70  0.70  0.90  0.70  | 0.80  0.80  0.90  0.80  | 0.95  0.95  0.95  0.95  |

3.  Other figures for permeability may be used if substantiated by calculations.   

### Regulation  8  

####Special requirements concerning passenger ship stability

1.  A passenger ship intended to carry 400 or more persons shall have watertight subdivision abaft the collision bulkhead so that *s <sub>i</sub>* = 1 for the three loading conditions on which is based the calculation of the subdivision index and for a damage involving all the compartments within 0.08 *L* measured from the forward perpendicular.   
2.  A passenger ship intended to carry 36 or more persons is to be capable of withstanding damage along the side shell to an extent specified in paragraph 3. Compliance with this regulation is to be achieved by demonstrating that *s <sub>i</sub>*, as defined in regulation 7-2, is not less than 0.9 for the three loading conditions on which is based the calculation of the subdivision index.   
3.  The damage extent to be assumed when demonstrating compliance with paragraph 2, is to be dependent on both *N* as defined in regulation 6, and *L <sub>s</sub>* as defined in regulation 2, such that: 

.1. the vertical extent of damage is to extend from the ship’s moulded baseline to a position up to 12.5 m above the position of the deepest subdivision draught as defined in regulation 2, unless a lesser vertical extent of damage were to give a lower value of *s <sub>i</sub>*, in which case this reduced extent is to be used;  

.2. where 400 or more persons are to be carried, a damage length of 0.03 *L <sub>s</sub>* but not less than 3 m is to be assumed at any position along the side shell, in conjunction with a penetration inboard of 0.1 *B* but not less than 0.75 m measured inboard from the ship side, at right angle to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught;  

.3. where less than 400 persons are carried, damage length is to be assumed at any position along the shell side between transverse watertight bulkheads provided that the distance between two adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is not less than the assumed damage length. If the distance between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is less than the assumed damage length, only one of these bulkheads shall be considered effective for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with paragraph 2;  

.4. where 36 persons are carried, a damage length of 0.015 *L <sub>s</sub>* but not less than 3 m is to be assumed, in conjunction with a penetration inboard of 0.05 *B* but not less than 0.75 m; and  

.5. where more than 36, but fewer than 400 persons are carried the values of damage length and penetration inboard, used in the determination of the assumed extent of damage, are to be obtained by linear interpolation between the values of damage length and penetration which apply for ships carrying 36 persons and 400 persons as specified in subparagraphs .4 and .2.     

### Regulation  8-1  

####System capabilities after a flooding casualty on passenger ships

1.  Application This regulation applies to passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 2010 to which regulation II-2/21 applies.   
2.  Availability of essential systems in case of flooding damage <sup> 6)  Refer to the Performance standards for the systems and services to remain operational on passenger ships for safe return to port and orderly evacuation and abandonment after a casualty (MSC.1/Circ. 1214).  </sup> A passenger ship shall be designed so that the systems specified in regulation II-2/21.4 remain operational when the ship is subject to flooding of any single watertight compartment.   

### PART  B-2  

####SUBDIVISION, WATERTIGHT AND WEATHERTIGHT INTEGRITY

### Regulation  9  

####Double bottoms in passenger ships and cargo ships other than tankers

1.  A double bottom shall be fitted extending from the collision bulkhead to the afterpeak bulkhead, as far as this is practicable and compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.   
2.  Where a double bottom is required to be fitted the inner bottom shall be continued out to the ship’s sides in such a manner as to protect the bottom to the turn of the bilge. Such protection will be deemed satisfactory if the inner bottom is not lower at any part than a plane parallel with the keel line and which is located not less than a vertical distance h measured from the keel line, as calculated by the formula: *h* = *B* /20 However, in no case is the value of *h* to be less than 760 mm, and need not be taken as more than 2,000 mm.   
3.  Small wells constructed in the double bottom in connection with drainage arrangements of holds, etc., shall not extend downward more than necessary. A well extending to the outer bottom is, however, permitted at the after end of the shaft tunnel. Other wells (e.g., for lubricating oil under main engines) may be permitted by the Administration if satisfied that the arrangements give protection equivalent to that afforded by a double bottom complying with this regulation. In no case shall the vertical distance from the bottom of such a well to a plane coinciding with the keel line be less than 500 mm.   
4.  A double bottom need not be fitted in way of watertight tanks, including dry tanks of moderate size, provided the safety of the ship is not impaired in the event of bottom or side damage.   
5.  In the case of passenger ships to which the provisions of regulation 1.5 apply and which are engaged on regular service within the limits of a short international voyage as defined in regulation III/3.22, the Administration may permit a double bottom to be dispensed with if satisfied that the fitting of a double bottom in that part would not be compatible with the design and proper working of the ship.   
6.  Any part of a passenger ship or a cargo ship that is not fitted with a double bottom in accordance with paragraphs 1, 4 or 5 shall be capable of withstanding bottom damages, as specified in paragraph 8, in that part of the ship.   
7.  In the case of unusual bottom arrangements in a passenger ship or a cargo ship, it shall be demonstrated that the ship is capable of withstanding bottom damages as specified in paragraph 8.   
8.  Compliance with paragraphs 6 or 7 is to be achieved by demonstrating that *s <sub>i</sub>*, when calculated in accordance with regulation 7-2, is not less than 1 for all service conditions when subject to a bottom damage assumed at any position along the ship’s bottom and with an extent specified in subparagraph .2 below for the affected part of the ship: 

.1. Flooding of such spaces shall not render emergency power and lighting, internal communication, signals or other emergency devices inoperable in other parts of the ship.  

.2. Assumed extent of damage shall be as follows:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
| --- | For 0.3 L from the forward perpendicular of the ship  | Any other part of the ship  |
| Longitudinal extent  | 1/3 *L*<sup>2/3</sup> or 14.5 m, whichever is less  | 1/3 *L*<sup>2/3</sup> or 14.5 m, whichever is less  |
| Transverse extent  | *B* /6 or 10 m, whichever is less  | *B* /6 or 5 m, whichever is less  |
| Vertical extent, measured from the keel line  | *B* /20 or 2 m, whichever is less  | B/20 or 2 m, whichever is less  |

.3. If any damage of a lesser extent than the maximum damage specified in subparagraph .2 would result in a more severe condition, such damage should be considered.     
9.  In case of large lower holds in passenger ships, the Administration may require an increased double bottom height of not more than *B* /10 or 3 m, whichever is less, measured from the keel line. Alternatively, bottom damages may be calculated for these areas, in accordance with paragraph 8, but assuming an increased vertical extent.   

### Regulation  10  

####Construction of watertight bulkheads

1.  Each watertight subdivision bulkhead, whether transverse or longitudinal, shall be constructed having scantlings as specified in regulation 2.17. In all cases, watertight subdivision bulkheads shall be capable of supporting at least the pressure due to a head of water up to the bulkhead deck.   
2.  Steps and recesses in watertight bulkheads shall be as strong as the bulkhead at the place where each occurs.   

### Regulation  11  

####Initial testing of watertight bulkheads, etc.

1.  Testing watertight spaces not intended to hold liquids and cargo holds intended to hold ballast by filling them with water is not compulsory. When testing by filling with water is not carried out, a hose test shall be carried out where practicable. This test shall be carried out in the most advanced stage of the fitting out of the ship. Where a hose test is not practicable because of possible damage to machinery, electrical equipment insulation or outfitting items, it may be replaced by a careful visual examination of welded connections, supported where deemed necessary by means such as a dye penetrant test or an ultrasonic leak test or an equivalent test. In any case a thorough inspection of the watertight bulkheads shall be carried out.   
2.  The forepeak, double bottom (including duct keels) and inner skins shall be tested with water to a head corresponding to the requirements of regulation 10.1.   
3.  Tanks which are intended to hold liquids, and which form part of the watertight subdivision of the ship, shall be tested for tightness and structural strength with water to a head corresponding to its design pressure. The water head is in no case to be less than the top of the air pipes or to a level of 2.4 m above the top of the tank, whichever is the greater.   
4.  The tests referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 are for the purpose of ensuring that the subdivision structural arrangements are watertight and are not to be regarded as a test of the fitness of any compartment for the storage of oil fuel or for other special purposes for which a test of a superior character may be required depending on the height to which the liquid has access in the tank or its connections.   

### Regulation  12  

####Peak and machinery space bulkheads, shaft tunnels, etc.

1.  A collision bulkhead shall be fitted which shall be watertight up to the bulkhead deck. This bulkhead shall be located at a distance from the forward perpendicular of not less than 0.05 *L* or 10 m, whichever is the less, and, except as may be permitted by the Administration, not more than 0.08 *L* or 0.05 *L* + 3 m, whichever is the greater.   
2.  Where any part of the ship below the waterline extends forward of the forward perpendicular, e.g., a bulbous bow, the distances stipulated in paragraph 1 shall be measured from a point either: 

.1. at the mid-length of such extension;  

.2. at a distance 0.015 *L* forward of the forward perpendicular; or  

.3. at a distance 3 m forward of the forward perpendicular, whichever gives the smallest measurement.     
3.  The bulkhead may have steps or recesses provided they are within the limits prescribed in paragraph 1 or 2.   
4.  No doors, manholes, access openings, ventilation ducts or any other openings shall be fitted in the collision bulkhead below the bulkhead deck.   
5.1.  Except as provided in paragraph 5.2, the collision bulkhead may be pierced below the bulkhead deck by not more than one pipe for dealing with fluid in the forepeak tank, provided that the pipe is fitted with a screw-down valve capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck, the valve chest being secured inside the forepeak to the collision bulkhead. The Administration may, however, authorize the fitting of this valve on the after side of the collision bulkhead provided that the valve is readily accessible under all service conditions and the space in which it is located is not a cargo space. All valves shall be of steel, bronze or other approved ductile material. Valves of ordinary cast iron or similar material are not acceptable.   
5.2.  If the forepeak is divided to hold two different kinds of liquids the Administration may allow the collision bulkhead to be pierced below the bulkhead deck by two pipes, each of which is fitted as required by paragraph 5.1, provided the Administration is satisfied that there is no practical alternative to the fitting of such a second pipe and that, having regard to the additional subdivision provided in the forepeak, the safety of the ship is maintained.   
6.  Where a long forward superstructure is fitted the collision bulkhead shall be extended weathertight to the deck next above the bulkhead deck. The extension need not be fitted directly above the bulkhead below provided it is located within the limits prescribed in paragraph 1 or 2 with the exception permitted by paragraph 7 and that the part of the deck which forms the step is made effectively weathertight. The extension shall be so arranged as to preclude the possibility of the bow door causing damage to it in the case of damage to, or detachment of, a bow door.   
7.  Where bow doors are fitted and a sloping loading ramp forms part of the extension of the collision bulkhead above the bulkhead deck the ramp shall be weathertight over its complete length. In cargo ships the part of the ramp which is more than 2.3 m above the bulkhead deck may extend forward of the limit specified in paragraph 1 or 2. Ramps not meeting the above requirements shall be disregarded as an extension of the collision bulkhead.   
8.  The number of openings in the extension of the collision bulkhead above the freeboard deck shall be restricted to the minimum compatible with the design and normal operation of the ship. All such openings shall be capable of being closed weathertight.   
9.  Bulkheads shall be fitted separating the machinery space from cargo and accommodation spaces forward and aft and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. In passenger ships an afterpeak bulkhead shall also be fitted and made watertight up to the bulkhead deck. The afterpeak bulkhead may, however, be stepped below the bulkhead deck, provided the degree of safety of the ship as regards subdivision is not thereby diminished.   
10.  In all cases stern tubes shall be enclosed in watertight spaces of moderate volume. In passenger ships the stern gland shall be situated in a watertight shaft tunnel or other watertight space separate from the stern tube compartment and of such volume that, if flooded by leakage through the stern gland, the bulkhead deck will not be immersed. In cargo ships other measures to minimize the danger of water penetrating into the ship in case of damage to stern tube arrangements may be taken at the discretion of the Administration.   

### Regulation  13  

####Openings in watertight bulkheads below the bulkhead deck in passenger ships

1.  The number of openings in watertight bulkheads shall be reduced to the minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship, satisfactory means shall be provided for closing these openings.   
2.1.  Where pipes, scuppers, electric cables, etc., are carried through watertight bulkheads, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.   
2.2.  Valves not forming part of a piping system shall not be permitted in watertight bulkheads.   
2.3.  Lead or other heat sensitive materials shall not be used in systems which penetrate watertight bulkheads, where deterioration of such systems in the event of fire would impair the watertight integrity of the bulkheads.   
3.  No doors, manholes, or access openings are permitted in watertight transverse bulkheads dividing a cargo space from an adjoining cargo space, except as provided in paragraph 9.1 and in regulation 14.   
4.  Subject to paragraph 10, not more than one door, apart from the doors to shaft tunnels, may be fitted in each watertight bulkhead within spaces containing the main and auxiliary propulsion machinery including boilers serving the needs of propulsion. Where two or more shafts are fitted, the tunnels shall be connected by an intercommunicating passage. There shall be only one door between the machinery space and the tunnel spaces where two shafts are fitted and only two doors where there are more than two shafts. All these doors shall be of the sliding type and shall be so located as to have their sills as high as practicable. The hand gear for operating these doors from above the bulkhead deck shall be situated outside the spaces containing the machinery.   
5.1.  Watertight doors, except as provided in paragraph 9.1 or regulation 14, shall be power-operated sliding doors complying with the requirements of paragraph 7 capable of being closed simultaneously from the central operating console at the navigation bridge in not more than 60 s with the ship in the upright position.   
5.2.  The means of operation whether by power or by hand of any power-operated sliding watertight door shall be capable of closing the door with the ship listed to 15°. either way. Consideration shall also be given to the forces which may act on either side of the door as may be experienced when water is flowing through the opening applying a static head equivalent to a water height of at least 1 m above the sill on the centreline of the door.   
5.3.  Watertight door controls, including hydraulic piping and electric cables, shall be kept as close as practicable to the bulkhead in which the doors are fitted, in order to minimize the likelihood of them being involved in any damage which the ship may sustain. The positioning of watertight doors and their controls shall be such that if the ship sustains damage within one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught, the operation of the watertight doors clear of the damaged portion of the ship is not impaired.   
6.  All power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be provided with means of indication which will show at all remote operating positions whether the doors are open or closed. Remote operating positions shall only be at the navigation bridge as required by paragraph 7.1.5 and at the location where hand operation above the bulkhead deck is required by paragraph 7.1.4.   
7.1.  Each power-operated sliding watertight door: 

.1. shall have a vertical or horizontal motion;  

.2. shall, subject to paragraph 10, be normally limited to a maximum clear opening width of 1.2 m. The Administration may permit larger doors only to the extent considered necessary for the effective operation of the ship provided that other safety measures, including the following, are taken into consideration: 

.1. special consideration shall be given to the strength of the door and its closing appliances in order to prevent leakages; and  

.2. the door shall be located inboard the damage zone B/5;  

.3. shall be fitted with the necessary equipment to open and close the door using electric power, hydraulic power, or any other form of power that is acceptable to the Administration;  

.4. shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from either side, and in addition, close the door from an accessible position above the bulkhead deck with an all round crank motion or some other movement providing the same degree of safety acceptable to the Administration. Direction of rotation or other movement is to be clearly indicated at all operating positions. The time necessary for the complete closure of the door, when operating by hand gear, shall not exceed 90 s with the ship in the upright position;  

.5. shall be provided with controls for opening and closing the door by power from both sides of the door and also for closing the door by power from the central operating console at the navigation bridge;  

.6. shall be provided with an audible alarm, distinct from any other alarm in the area, which will sound whenever the door is closed remotely by power and which shall sound for at least 5 s but no more than 10 s before the door begins to move and shall continue sounding until the door is completely closed. In the case of remote hand operation it is sufficient for the audible alarm to sound only when the door is moving. Additionally, in passenger areas and areas of high ambient noise the Administration may require the audible alarm to be supplemented by an intermittent visual signal at the door; and  

.7. shall have an approximately uniform rate of closure under power. The closure time, from the time the door begins to move to the time it reaches the completely closed position shall in no case be less than 20 s or more than 40 s with the ship in the upright position.       
7.2.  The electrical power required for power-operated sliding watertight doors shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck. The associated control, indication and alarm circuits shall be supplied from the emergency switchboard either directly or by a dedicated distribution board situated above the bulkhead deck and be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power required by regulation 42.3.1.3 in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power.   
7.3.  Power-operated sliding watertight doors shall have either: 

.1. a centralized hydraulic system with two independent power sources each consisting of a motor and pump capable of simultaneously closing all doors. In addition, there shall be for the whole installation hydraulic accumulators of sufficient capacity to operate all the doors at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15º. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. The power operating system shall be designed to minimize the possibility of having a single failure in the hydraulic piping adversely affect the operation of more than one door. The hydraulic system shall be provided with a low-level alarm for hydraulic fluid reservoirs serving the power-operated system and a low gas pressure alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators. These alarms are to be audible and visual and shall be situated on the central operating console at the navigation bridge; or  

.2. an independent hydraulic system for each door with each power source consisting of a motor and pump capable of opening and closing the door. In addition, there shall be a hydraulic accumulator of sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. This operating cycle shall be capable of being carried out when the accumulator is at the pump cut-in pressure. The fluid used shall be chosen considering the temperatures liable to be encountered by the installation during its service. A low gas pressure group alarm or other effective means of monitoring loss of stored energy in hydraulic accumulators shall be provided at the central operating console on the navigation bridge. Loss of stored energy indication at each local operating position shall also be provided; or  

.3. an independent electrical system and motor for each door with each power source consisting of a motor capable of opening and closing the door. The power source shall be capable of being automatically supplied by the transitional source of emergency electrical power as required by regulation 42.4.2 – in the event of failure of either the main or emergency source of electrical power and with sufficient capacity to operate the door at least three times, i.e. closed-open-closed, against an adverse list of 15°. For the systems specified in paragraphs 7.3.1, 7.3.2 and 7.3.3, provision should be made as follows: Power systems for power-operated watertight sliding doors shall be separate from any other power system. A single failure in the electric or hydraulic power-operated systems excluding the hydraulic actuator shall not prevent the hand operation of any door.     
7.4.  Control handles shall be provided at each side of the bulkhead at a minimum height of 1.6 m above the floor and shall be so arranged as to enable persons passing through the doorway to hold both handles in the open position without being able to set the power closing mechanism in operation accidentally. The direction of movement of the handles in opening and closing the door shall be in the direction of door movement and shall be clearly indicated.   
7.5.  As far as practicable, electrical equipment and components for watertight doors shall be situated above the bulkhead deck and outside hazardous areas and spaces.   
7.6.  The enclosures of electrical components necessarily situated below the bulkhead deck shall provide suitable protection against the ingress of water. <sup> 7)  Refer to the following publication IEC 529(1976):    .1.  electrical motors, associated circuits and control components; protected to IPX 7 standard;    .2.  door position indicators and associated circuit components; protected to IPX 8 standard; and    .3.  door movement warning signals; protected to IPX 6 standard.     Other arrangements for the enclosures of electrical components may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved. The water pressure IPX 8 shall be based on the pressure that may occur at the location of the component during flooding for a period of 36 h.  </sup>   
7.7.  Electric power, control, indication and alarm circuits shall be protected against fault in such a way that a failure in one door circuit will not cause a failure in any other door circuit. Short circuits or other faults in the alarm or indicator circuits of a door shall not result in a loss of power operation of that door. Arrangements shall be such that leakage of water into the electrical equipment located below the bulkhead deck will not cause the door to open.   
7.8.  A single electrical failure in the power operating or control system of a power-operated sliding watertight door shall not result in a closed door opening. Availability of the power supply should be continuously monitored at a point in the electrical circuit as near as practicable to each of the motors required by paragraph 7.3. Loss of any such power supply should activate an audible and visual alarm at the central operating console at the navigation bridge.   
8.1.  The central operating console at the navigation bridge shall have a “master mode” switch with two modes of control: a “local control” mode which shall allow any door to be locally opened and locally closed after use without automatic closure, and a “doors closed” mode which shall automatically close any door that is open. The “doors closed” mode shall automatically close any door that is open. The “doors closed” mode shall permit doors to be opened locally and shall automatically re-close the doors upon release of the local control mechanism. The “master mode” switch shall normally be in the “local control” mode. The “doors closed” mode shall only be used in an emergency or for testing purposes. Special consideration shall be given to the reliability of the “master mode” switch.   
8.2.  The central operating console at the navigation bridge shall be provided with a diagram showing the location of each door, with visual indicators to show whether each door is open or closed. A red light shall indicate a door is fully open and a green light shall indicate a door is fully closed. When the door is closed remotely the red light shall indicate the intermediate position by flashing. The indicating circuit shall be independent of the control circuit for each door.   
8.3.  It shall not be possible to remotely open any door from the central operating console.   
9.1.  If the Administration is satisfied that such doors are essential, watertight doors of satisfactory construction may be fitted in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo between deck spaces. Such doors may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors but shall not be remotely controlled. They shall be fitted at the highest level and as far from the shell plating as practicable, but in no case shall the outboard vertical edges be situated at a distance from the shell plating which is less than one fifth of the breadth of the ship, as defined in regulation 2, such distance being measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision draught.   
9.2.  Should any such doors be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening. When it is proposed to fit such doors, the number and arrangements shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.   
10.  Portable plates on bulkheads shall not be permitted except in machinery spaces. The Administration may permit not more than one power-operated sliding watertight door in each watertight bulkhead larger than those specified in paragraph 7.1.2 to be substituted for these portable plates, provided these doors are intended to remain closed during navigation except in case of urgent necessity at the discretion of the master. These doors need not meet the requirements of paragraph 7.1.4 regarding complete closure by hand-operated gear in 90 s.   
11.1.  Where trunkways or tunnels for access from crew accommodation to the stokehold, for piping, or for any other purpose are carried through watertight bulkheads, they shall be watertight and in accordance with the requirements of regulation 16-1. The access to at least one end of each such tunnel or trunkway, if used as a passage at sea, shall be through a trunk extending watertight to a height sufficient to permit access above the bulkhead deck. The access to the other end of the trunkway or tunnel may be through a watertight door of the type required by its location in the ship. Such trunkways or tunnels shall not extend through the first subdivision bulkhead abaft the collision bulkhead.   
11.2.  Where it is proposed to fit tunnels piercing watertight bulkheads, these shall receive the special consideration of the Administration.   
11.3.  Where trunkways in connection with refrigerated cargo and ventilation or forced draught trunks are carried through more than one watertight bulkhead, the means of closure at such openings shall be operated by power and be capable of being closed from a central position situated above the bulkhead deck.   

### Regulation  13-1  

####Openings in watertight bulkheads and internal decks in cargo ships

1.  The number of openings in watertight subdivisions is to be kept to a minimum compatible with the design and proper working of the ship. Where penetrations of watertight bulkheads and internal decks are necessary for access, piping, ventilation, electrical cables, etc., arrangements are to be made to maintain the watertight integrity. The Administration may permit relaxation in the watertightness of openings above the freeboard deck, provided that it is demonstrated that any progressive flooding can be easily controlled and that the safety of the ship is not impaired.   
2.  Doors provided to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings which are used while at sea are to be sliding watertight doors capable of being remotely closed from the bridge and are also to be operable locally from each side of the bulkhead. Indicators are to be provided at the control position showing whether the doors are open or closed, and an audible alarm is to be provided at the door closure. The power, control and indicators are to be operable in the event of main power failure. Particular attention is to be paid to minimizing the effect of control system failure. Each power-operated sliding watertight door shall be provided with an individual hand-operated mechanism. It shall be possible to open and close the door by hand at the door itself from both sides.   
3.  Access doors and access hatch covers normally closed at sea, intended to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings, shall be provided with means of indication locally and on the bridge showing whether these doors or hatch covers are open or closed. A notice is to be affixed to each such door or hatch cover to the effect that it is not to be left open.   
4.  Watertight doors or ramps of satisfactory construction may be fitted to internally subdivide large cargo spaces, provided that the Administration is satisfied that such doors or ramps are essential. These doors or ramps may be hinged, rolling or sliding doors or ramps, but shall not be remotely controlled. Should any of the doors or ramps be accessible during the voyage, they shall be fitted with a device which prevents unauthorized opening. <sup> 8)  Refer to Interpretations of regulations of part B-1 of SOLAS chapter II-1 (MSC/Circ.651).  </sup>   
5.  Other closing appliances which are kept permanently closed at sea to ensure the watertight integrity of internal openings shall be provided with a notice which is to be affixed to each such closing appliance to the effect that it is to be kept closed. Manholes fitted with closely bolted covers need not be so marked.   

### Regulation  14  

####Passenger ships carrying goods vehicles and accompanying personnel

1.  This regulation applies to passenger ships designed or adapted for the carriage of goods vehicles and accompanying personnel.   
2.  If in such a ship the total number of passengers which include personnel accompanying vehicles does not exceed 12 + *A <sub>d</sub>* /25, where *A <sub>d</sub>* = total deck area (square metres) of spaces available for the stowage of goods vehicles and where the clear height at the stowage position and at the entrance to such spaces is not less than 4 m, the provisions of regulations 13.9.1 and 13.9.2 in respect of watertight doors apply except that the doors may be fitted at any level in watertight bulkheads dividing cargo spaces. Additionally, indicators are required on the navigation bridge to show automatically when each door is closed and all door fastenings are secured.   
3.  The ship may not be certified for a higher number of passengers than assumed in paragraph 2, if a watertight door has been fitted in accordance with this regulation.

####Construction and initial tests of watertight doors, sidescuttles, etc.

1.  In all ships: 

.1. the design, materials and construction of all watertight doors, sidescuttles, gangway and cargo ports, valves, pipes, ash-chutes and rubbish-chutes referred to in these regulations shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration;  

.2. such valves, doors and mechanisms shall be suitably marked to ensure that they may be properly used to provide maximum safety; and  

.3. the frames of vertical watertight doors shall have no groove at the bottom in which dirt might lodge and prevent the door closing properly.     
2.  In passenger ships and cargo ships watertight doors shall be tested by water pressure to a head of water they might sustain in a final or intermediate stage of flooding. Where testing of individual doors is not carried out because of possible damage to insulation or outfitting items, testing of individual doors may be replaced by a prototype pressure test of each type and size of door with a test pressure corresponding at least to the head required for the intended location. The prototype test shall be carried out before the door is fitted. The installation method and procedure for fitting the door on board shall correspond to that of the prototype test. When fitted on board, each door shall be checked for proper seating between the bulkhead, the frame and the door.   

### Regulation  16-1  

####Construction and initial tests of watertight decks, trunks, etc.

1.  Watertight decks, trunks, tunnels, duct keels and ventilators shall be of the same strength as watertight bulkheads at corresponding levels. The means used for making them watertight, and the arrangements adopted for closing openings in them, shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration. Watertight ventilators and trunks shall be carried at least up to the bulkhead deck in passenger ships and up to the freeboard deck in cargo ships.   
2.  Where a ventilation trunk passing through a structure penetrates the bulkhead deck, the trunk shall be capable of withstanding the water pressure that may be present within the trunk, after having taken into account the maximum heel angle allowable during intermediate stages of flooding, in accordance with regulation 7-2.   
3.  Where all or part of the penetration of the bulkhead deck is on the main ro-ro deck, the trunk shall be capable of withstanding impact pressure due to internal water motions (sloshing) of water trapped on the ro-ro deck.   
4.  After completion, a hose or flooding test shall be applied to watertight decks and a hose test to watertight trunks, tunnels and ventilators.   

### Regulation  17  

####Internal watertight integrity of passenger ships above the bulkhead deck

1.  The Administration may require that all reasonable and practicable measures shall be taken to limit the entry and spread of water above the bulkhead deck. Such measures may include partial bulkheads or webs. When partial watertight bulkheads and webs are fitted on the bulkhead deck, above or in the immediate vicinity of watertight bulkheads, they shall have watertight shell and bulkhead deck connections so as to restrict the flow of water along the deck when the ship is in a heeled damaged condition. Where the partial watertight bulkhead does not line up with the bulkhead below, the bulkhead deck between shall be made effectively watertight. Where openings, pipes, scuppers, electric cables etc. are carried through the partial watertight bulkheads or decks within the immersed part of the bulkhead deck, arrangements shall be made to ensure the watertight integrity of the structure above the bulkhead deck. <sup> 9)  Refer to the Guidance notes on the integrity of flooding boundaries above the bulkhead deck of passenger ships for proper application of regulations II-1/8 and 20, paragraph 1, of SOLAS 1974, as amended (MSC/Circ.541, as may be amended).  </sup>   
2.  All openings in the exposed weather deck shall have coamings of ample height and strength and shall be provided with efficient means for expeditiously closing them weathertight. Freeing ports, open rails and scuppers shall be fitted as necessary for rapidly clearing the weather deck of water under all weather conditions.   
3.  The open end of air pipes terminating within a superstructure shall be at least 1 m above the waterline when the ship heels to an angle of 15º, or the maximum angle of heel during intermediate stages of flooding, as determined by direct calculation, whichever is the greater. Alternatively, air pipes from tanks other than oil tanks may discharge through the side of the superstructure. The provisions of this paragraph are without prejudice to the provisions of the [International Convention on Load Lines](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md) in force.   
4.  Sidescuttles, gangway, cargo and fuelling ports and other means for closing openings in the shell plating above the bulkhead deck shall be of efficient design and construction and of sufficient strength having regard to the spaces in which they are fitted and their positions relative to the deepest subdivision draught. <sup> 10)  Refer to the Recommendation on strength and security and locking arrangements of shell doors on ro-ro passenger ships, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.793(19).  </sup>   
5.  Efficient inside deadlights, so arranged that they can be easily and effectively closed and secured watertight, shall be provided for all sidescuttles to spaces below the first deck above the bulkhead deck.   

### Regulation  17–1  

####Integrity of the hull and superstructure, damage prevention and control on ro-ro passenger ships

1.1.  Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3, all accesses that lead to spaces below the bulkhead deck shall have a lowest point which is not less than 2.5 m above the bulkhead deck.   
1.2.  Where vehicle ramps are installed to give access to spaces below the bulkhead deck, their openings shall be able to be closed weathertight to prevent ingress of water below, alarmed and indicated to the navigation bridge.   
1.3.

2.  Passenger ships and cargo ships 

2.1. An efficient bilge pumping system shall be provided, capable of pumping from and draining any watertight compartment other than a space permanently appropriated for the carriage of fresh water, water ballast, oil fuel or liquid cargo and for which other efficient means of pumping are provided, under all practical conditions. Efficient means shall be provided for draining water from insulated holds.  

2.2. Sanitary, ballast and general service pumps may be accepted as independent power bilge pumps if fitted with the necessary connections to the bilge pumping system.  

2.3. All bilge pipes used in or under coal bunkers or fuel storage tanks or in boiler or machinery spaces, including spaces in which oil-settling tanks or oil fuel pumping units are situated, shall be of steel or other suitable material.  

2.4. The arrangement of the bilge and ballast pumping system shall be such as to prevent the possibility of water passing from the sea and from water ballast spaces into the cargo and machinery spaces, or from one compartment to another. Provision shall be made to prevent any deep tank having bilge and ballast connections being inadvertently flooded from the sea when containing cargo, or being discharged through a bilge pump when containing water ballast.  

2.5. All distribution boxes and manually operated valves in connection with the bilge pumping arrangements shall be in positions which are accessible under ordinary circumstances.  

2.6. Provision shall be made for the drainage of enclosed cargo spaces situated on the bulkhead deck of a passenger ship and on the freeboard deck of a cargo ship, provided that the Administration may permit the means of drainage to be dispensed with in any particular compartment of any ship or class of ship if it is satisfied that by reason of size or internal subdivision of those spaces the safety of the ship is not thereby impaired. 

2.6.1. Where the freeboard to the bulkhead deck or the freeboard deck, respectively, is such that the deck edge is immersed when the ship heels more than 5°, the drainage shall be by means of a sufficient number of scuppers of suitable size discharging directly overboard, fitted in accordance with the requirements of regulation 15 in the case of a passenger ship and the requirements for scuppers, inlets and discharges of the [International Convention on Load Lines](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md) in force in the case of a cargo ship.  

2.6.2. Where the freeboard is such that the edge of the bulkhead deck or the edge of the freeboard deck, respectively, is immersed when the ship heels 5° or less, the drainage of the enclosed cargo spaces on the bulkhead deck or on the freeboard deck, respectively, shall be led to a suitable space, or spaces, of adequate capacity, having a high water level alarm and provided with suitable arrangements for discharge overboard. In addition it shall be ensured that: 

.1. the number, size and disposition of the scuppers are such as to prevent unreasonable accumulation of free water;  

.2. the pumping arrangements required by this regulation for passenger ships or cargo ships, as applicable, take account of the requirements for any fixed pressure water-spraying fire extinguishing system;  

.3. water contaminated with petrol or other dangerous substances is not drained to machinery spaces or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present; and  

.4. where the enclosed cargo space is protected by a carbon dioxide fire extinguishing system the deck scuppers are fitted with means to prevent the escape of the smothering gas.    

2.6.3 Provisions for the drainage of closed vehicle and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces shall also comply with regulations II-2/20.6.1.4 and II-2/20.6.1.5.       
3.  Passenger ships 

3.1. The bilge pumping system required by paragraph 2.1 shall be capable of operation under all practicable conditions after a casualty whether the ship is upright or listed. For this purpose wing suctions shall generally be fitted except in narrow compartments at the end of the ship where one suction may be sufficient. In compartments of unusual form, additional suctions may be required. Arrangements shall be made whereby water in the compartment may find its way to the suction pipes. Where, for particular compartments, the Administration is satisfied that the provision of drainage may be undesirable, it may allow such provision to be dispensed with if calculations made in accordance with the conditions laid down in regulations 7 and 8 show that the survival capability of the ship will not be impaired.  

3.2. At least three power pumps shall be fitted connected to the bilge main, one of which may be driven by the propulsion machinery. Where the bilge pump numeral is 30 or more, one additional independent power pump shall be provided. The bilge pump numeral shall be calculated as follows:   ![10000053231](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053231)
where: *L* = the length of the ship (metres), as defined in regulation 2; *M* = the volume of the machinery space (cubic metres), as defined in regulation 2, that is below the bulkhead deck; with the addition thereto of the volume of any permanent oil fuel bunkers which may be situated above the inner bottom and forward of, or abaft, the machinery space; *P* = the whole volume of the passenger and crew spaces below the bulkhead deck (cubic metres), which are provided for the accommodation and use of passengers and crew, excluding baggage, store, provision and mail rooms; *V* = the whole volume of the ship below the bulkhead deck (cubic metres); *P*<sub>1</sub> = *KN*, where: *N* = the number of passengers for which the ship is to be certified; and *K* = 0.056 *L* However, where the value of *KN* is greater than the sum of *P* and the whole volume of the actual passenger spaces above the bulkhead deck, the figure to be taken as *P* 1 is that sum or two-thirds *KN*, whichever is the greater.  

3.3. Where practicable, the power bilge pumps shall be placed in separate watertight compartments and so arranged or situated that these compartments will not be flooded by the same damage. If the main propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery and boilers are in two or more watertight compartments, the pumps available for bilge service shall be distributed as far as is possible throughout these compartments.  

3.4. On a ship of 91.5 m in length and upwards or having a bilge pump numeral, calculated in accordance with paragraph 3.2, of 30 or more, the arrangements shall be such that at least one power bilge pump shall be available for use in all flooding conditions which the ship is required to withstand, as follows: 

.1. one of the required bilge pumps shall be an emergency pump of a reliable submersible type having a source of power situated above the bulkhead deck; or  

.2. the bilge pumps and their sources of power shall be so distributed throughout the length of the ship that at least one pump in an undamaged compartment will be available.    

3.5. With the exception of additional pumps which may be provided for peak compartments only, each required bilge pump shall be so arranged as to draw water from any space required to be drained by paragraph 2.1.  

3.6. Each power bilge pump shall be capable of pumping water through the required main bilge pipe at a speed of not less than 2 m/s. Independent power bilge pumps situated in machinery spaces shall have direct suctions from these spaces, except that not more than two such suctions shall be required in any one space. Where two or more such suctions are provided, there shall be at least one on each side of the ship. The Administration may require independent power bilge pumps situated in other spaces to have separate direct suctions. Direct suctions shall be suitably arranged and those in a machinery space shall be of a diameter not less than that required for the bilge main.  

3.7.1. In addition to the direct bilge suction or suctions required by paragraph 3.6, a direct suction from the main circulating pump leading to the drainage level of the machinery space and fitted with a non-return valve shall be provided in the machinery space. The diameter of this direct suction pipe shall be at least two thirds of the diameter of the pump inlet in the case of steamships, and of the same diameter as the pump inlet in the case of motorships.  

3.7.2. Where in the opinion of the Administration the main circulating pump is not suitable for this purpose, a direct emergency bilge suction shall be led from the largest available independent power driven pump to the drainage level of the machinery space; the suction shall be of the same diameter as the main inlet of the pump used. The capacity of the pump so connected shall exceed that of a required bilge pump by an amount deemed satisfactory by the Administration.  

3.7.3. The spindles of the sea inlet and direct suction valves shall extend well above the engine-room platform.  

3.8. All bilge suction piping up to the connection to the pumps shall be independent of other piping.  

3.9. The diameter *d* of the bilge main shall be calculated according to the following formula. However, the actual internal diameter of the bilge main may be rounded off to the nearest standard size acceptable to the Administration:   ![10000053232](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053232)
where: *d* is the internal diameter of the bilge main (millimetres); *L* and *B* are the length and the breadth of the ship (metres) as defined in regulation 2; and *D* is the moulded depth of the ship to the bulkhead deck (metres) provided that, in a ship having an enclosed cargo space on the bulkhead deck which is internally drained in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 2.6.2 and which extends for the full length of the ship, *D* shall be measured to the next deck above the bulkhead deck. Where the enclosed cargo spaces cover a lesser length, *D* shall be taken as the moulded depth to the bulkhead deck plus *lh/L* where *l* and *h* are the aggregate length and height respectively of the enclosed cargo spaces (metres). The diameter of the bilge branch pipes shall meet the requirements of the Administration.  

3.10. Provision shall be made to prevent the compartment served by any bilge suction pipe being flooded in the event of the pipe being severed or otherwise damaged by collision or grounding in any other compartment. For this purpose, where the pipe is at any part situated nearer the side of the ship than one fifth of the breadth of the ship (as defined in regulation 2 and measured at right angles to the centreline at the level of the deepest subdivision load line), or is in a duct keel, a non-return valve shall be fitted to the pipe in the compartment containing the open end.  

3.11. Distribution boxes, cocks and valves in connection with the bilge pumping system shall be so arranged that, in the event of flooding, one of the bilge pumps may be operative on any compartment; in addition, damage to a pump or its pipe connecting to the bilge main outboard of a line drawn at one fifth of the breadth of the ship shall not put the bilge system out of action. If there is only one system of pipes common to all the pumps, the necessary valves for controlling the bilge suctions must be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck. Where in addition to the main bilge pumping system an emergency bilge pumping system is provided, it shall be independent of the main system and so arranged that a pump is capable of operating on any compartment under flooding condition as specified in paragraph 3.1; in that case only the valves necessary for the operation of the emergency system need be capable of being operated from above the bulkhead deck.  

3.12. All cocks and valves referred to in paragraph 3.11 which can be operated from above the bulkhead deck shall have their controls at their place of operation clearly marked and shall be provided with means to indicate whether they are open or closed.     
4.  Cargo ships At least two power pumps connected to the main bilge system shall be provided, one of which may be driven by the propulsion machinery. If the Administration is satisfied that the safety of the ship is not impaired, bilge pumping arrangements may be dispensed with in particular compartments.   

### Regulation  36  

####Protection against noise

<sup> *)  Reference is made to the Code on Noise Levels on Board Ships, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.468(XII).  </sup>  Measures shall be taken to reduce machinery noise in machinery spaces to acceptable levels as determined by the Administration. If this noise cannot be sufficiently reduced the source of excessive noise shall be suitably insulated or isolated or a refuge from noise shall be provided if the space is required to be manned. Ear protectors shall be provided for personnel required to enter such spaces, if necessary.  

### Regulation  37

2.2.  The arrangement of the main electric lighting system shall be such that a fire or other casualty in spaces containing the main source of electrical power, associated transforming equipment, if any, the main switchboard and the main lighting switchboard, will not render the emergency electric lighting system required by Regulations 42.2.1 and 42.2.2 or 43.2.1, 43.2.2 and 43.2.3 inoperative.   
2.3.  The arrangement of the emergency electric lighting system shall be such that a fire or other casualty in spaces containing the emergency source of electrical power, associated transforming equipment, if any, the emergency switchboard and the emergency lighting switchboard will not render the main electric lighting system required by this Regulation inoperative.   
3.  The main switchboard shall be so placed relative to one main generating station that, as far as is practicable, the integrity of the normal electrical supply may be affected only by a fire or other casualty in one space. An environmental enclosure for the main switchboard, such as may be provided by a machinery control room situated within the main boundaries of the space, is not to be considered as separating the switchboards from the generators.   
4.  Where the total installed electrical power of the main generating sets is in excess of 3 MW, the main busbars shall be subdivided into at least two parts which shall normally be connected by removable links or other approved means; so far as is practicable, the connexion of generating sets and any other duplicated equipment shall be equally divided between the parts. Equivalent arrangements may be permitted to the satisfaction of the Administration.   
5.  Ships constructed on or after 1 July 1998: 

.1 in addition to paragraphs 1 to 3, shall comply with the following: 

.1.1 where the main source of electrical power is necessary for propulsion and steering of the ship, the system shall be so arranged that the electrical supply to equipment necessary for propulsion and steering and to ensure safety of the ship will be maintained or immediately restored in the case of loss of any one of the generators in service;  

.1.2 load shedding or other equivalent arrangements shall be provided to protect the generators required by this regulation against sustained overload;

###2 Arrangements for oil fuel, lubrication oil and other flammable oils

2.1 Limitations in the use of oils as fuel The following limitations shall apply to the use of oil as fuel: 

.1 except as otherwise permitted by this paragraph, no oil fuel with a flashpoint of less than 60°C shall be used;  

.2 in emergency generators oil fuel with a flashpoint of not less than 43°C may be used;  

.3 the use of oil fuel having a flashpoint of less than 60°C but not less than 43°C may be permitted (e.g., for feeding the emergency fire pump's engines and the auxiliary machines which are not located in the machinery spaces of category A) subject to the following: 

.3.1 fuel oil tanks except those arranged in double bottom compartments shall be located outside of machinery spaces of category A;  

.3.2 provisions for the measurement of oil temperature are provided on the suction pipe of the oil fuel pump;  

.3.3 stop valves and/or cocks are provided on the inlet side and outlet side of the oil fuel strainers; and  

.3.4 pipe joints of welded construction or of circular cone type or spherical type union joint are applied as much as possible; and    

.4 in cargo ships the use of fuel having a lower flashpoint than otherwise specified in paragraph 2.1, for example crude oil, may be permitted provided that such fuel is not stored in any machinery space and subject to the approval by the Administration of the complete installation.    

2.2 Arrangements for oil fuel In a ship in which oil fuel is used, the arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of the oil fuel shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board and shall at least comply with the following provisions. 

2.2.1 Location of oil fuel systems As far as practicable, parts of the oil fuel system containing heated oil under pressure exceeding 0.18 N/mm2 shall not be placed in a concealed position such that defects and leakage cannot readily be observed. The machinery spaces in way of such parts of the oil fuel system shall be adequately illuminated.  

2.2.2 Ventilation of machinery spaces The ventilation of machinery spaces shall be sufficient under normal conditions to prevent accumulation of oil vapour.  

2.2.3 Oil fuel tanks 

2.2.3.1 Fuel oil, lubrication oil and other flammable oils shall not be carried in forepeak tanks.  

2.2.3.2 As far as practicable, oil fuel tanks shall be part of the ship's structure and shall be located outside machinery spaces of category A. Where oil fuel tanks, other than double bottom tanks, are necessarily located adjacent to or within machinery spaces of category A, at least one of their vertical sides shall be contiguous to the machinery space boundaries, and shall preferably have a common boundary with the double bottom tanks, and the area of the tank boundary common with the machinery spaces shall be kept to a minimum. Where such tanks are situated within the boundaries of machinery spaces of category A they shall not contain oil fuel having a flashpoint of less than 60°C. In general, the use of free-standing oil fuel tanks shall be avoided. When such tanks are employed their use shall be prohibited in category A machinery spaces on passenger ships. Where permitted, they shall be placed in an oil-tight spill tray of ample size having a suitable drain pipe leading to a suitably sized spill oil tank.  

2.2.3.3 No oil fuel tank shall be situated where spillage or leakage therefrom can constitute a fire or explosion hazard by falling on heated surfaces.  

2.2.3.4 Oil fuel pipes, which, if damaged, would allow oil to escape from a storage, settling or daily service tank having a capacity of 500 l and above situated above the double bottom, shall be fitted with a cock or valve directly on the tank capable of being closed from a safe position outside the space concerned in the event of a fire occurring in the space in which such tanks are situated. In the special case of deep tanks situated in any shaft or pipe tunnel or similar space, valves on the tank shall be fitted, but control in the event of fire may be effected by means of an additional valve on the pipe or pipes outside the tunnel or similar space. If such an additional valve is fitted in the machinery space it shall be operated from a position outside this space. The controls for remote operation of the valve for the emergency generator fuel tank shall be in a separate location from the controls for remote operation of other valves for tanks located in machinery spaces.  

2.2.3.5 Safe and efficient means of ascertaining the amount of oil fuel contained in any oil fuel tank shall be provided. 

2.2.3.5.1 Where sounding pipes are used, they shall not terminate in any space where the risk of ignition of spillage from the sounding pipe might arise. In particular, they shall not terminate in passenger or crew spaces. As a general rule, they shall not terminate in machinery spaces. However, where the Administration considers that these latter requirements are impracticable, it may permit termination of sounding pipes in machinery spaces on condition that all of the following requirements are met: 

.1 an oil-level gauge is provided meeting the requirements of paragraph 2.2.3.5.2;  

.2 the sounding pipes terminate in locations remote from ignition hazards unless precautions are taken, such as the fitting of effective screens, to prevent the oil fuel in the case of spillage through the terminations of the sounding pipes from coming into contact with a source of ignition; and  

.3 the termination of sounding pipes are fitted with self-closing blanking devices and with a small-diameter self-closing control cock located below the blanking device for the purpose of ascertaining before the blanking device is opened that oil fuel is not present. Provisions shall be made so as to ensure that any spillage of oil fuel through the control cock involves no ignition hazard.    

2.2.3.5.2 Other oil-level gauges may be used in place of sounding pipes subject to the following conditions: 

.1 in passenger ships, such gauges shall not require penetration below the top of the tank and their failure or overfilling of the tanks shall not permit release of fuel; and  

.2 in cargo ships, the failure of such gauges or overfilling of the tank shall not permit release of fuel into the space. The use of cylindrical gauge glasses is prohibited. The Administration may permit the use of oil-level gauges with flat glasses and self-closing valves between the gauges and fuel tanks.    

2.2.3.5.3 The means prescribed in paragraph 2.2.3.5.2 which are acceptable to the Administration shall be maintained in the proper condition to ensure their continued accurate functioning in service.      

2.2.4 Prevention of overpressure Provisions shall be made to prevent overpressure in any oil tank or in any part of the oil fuel system, including the filling pipes served by pumps on board. Air and overflow pipes and relief valves shall discharge to a position where there is no risk of fire or explosion from the emergence of oils and vapour and shall not lead into crew spaces, passenger spaces nor into special category spaces, closed ro-ro spaces, machinery spaces or similar spaces.  

2.2.5 Oil fuel piping 

2.2.5.1 Oil fuel pipes and their valves and fittings shall be of steel or other approved material, except that restricted use of flexible pipes shall be permissible in positions where the Administration is satisfied that they are necessary. Such flexible pipes and end attachments shall be of approved fire-resisting materials of adequate strength and shall be constructed to the satisfaction of the Administration. For valves, fitted to oil fuel tanks and which are under static pressure, steel or spheroidal-graphite cast iron may be accepted. However, ordinary cast iron valves may be used in piping systems where the design pressure is lower than 7 bar and the design temperature is below 60°C.  

2.2.5.2 External high-pressure fuel delivery lines between the high-pressure fuel pumps and fuel injectors shall be protected with a jacketed piping system capable of containing fuel from a high-pressure line failure. A jacketed pipe incorporates an outer pipe into which the high-pressure fuel pipe is placed, forming a permanent assembly. The jacketed piping system shall include a means for collection of leakages and arrangements shall be provided with an alarm in case of a fuel line failure.  

2.2.5.3 Oil fuel lines shall not be located immediately above or near units of high temperature including boilers, steam pipelines, exhaust manifolds, silencers or other equipment required to be insulated by paragraph 2.2.6. As far as practicable, oil fuel lines shall be arranged far apart from hot surfaces, electrical installations or other sources of ignition and shall be screened or otherwise suitably protected to avoid oil spray or oil leakage onto the sources of ignition. The number of joints in such piping systems shall be kept to a minimum.  

2.2.5.4 Components of a diesel engine fuel system shall be designed considering the maximum peak pressure which will be experienced in service, including any high pressure pulses which are generated and transmitted back into the fuel supply and spill lines by the action of fuel injection pumps. Connections within the fuel supply and spill lines shall be constructed having regard to their ability to prevent pressurized oil fuel leaks while in service and after maintenance.  

2.2.5.5 In multi-engine installations which are supplied from the same fuel source, means of isolating the fuel supply and spill piping to individual engines, shall be provided. The means of isolation shall not affect the operation of the other engines and shall be operable from a position not rendered inaccessible by a fire on any of the engines.  

2.2.5.6 Where the Administration may permit the conveying of oil and combustible liquids through accommodation and service spaces, the pipes conveying oil or combustible liquids shall be of a material approved by the Administration having regard to the fire risk.    

2.2.6 Protection of high temperature surfaces 

2.2.6.1 Surfaces with temperatures above 220°C which may be impinged as a result of a fuel system failure shall be properly insulated.  

2.2.6.2 Precautions shall be taken to prevent any oil that may escape under pressure from any pump, filter or heater from coming into contact with heated surfaces.      

2.3 Arrangements for lubricating oil 

2.3.1 The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of oil used in pressure lubrication systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board. The arrangements made in machinery spaces of category A, and whenever practicable in other machinery spaces, shall at least comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.1, 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.4, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.5.1, 2.2.5.3 and 2.2.6, except that: 

.1 this does not preclude the use of sight-flow glasses in lubricating systems provided that they are shown by testing to have a suitable degree of fire resistance; and  

.2 sounding pipes may be authorized in machinery spaces; however, the requirements of paragraphs 2.2.3.5.1.1 and 2.2.3.5.1.3 need not be applied on condition that the sounding pipes are fitted with appropriate means of closure.    

2.3.2 The provisions of paragraph 2.2.3.4 shall also apply to lubricating oil tanks except those having a capacity less than 500 l, storage tanks on which valves are closed during the normal operation mode of the ship, or where it is determined that an unintended operation of a quick closing valve on the oil lubricating tank would endanger the safe operation of the main propulsion and essential auxiliary machinery.    

2.4 Arrangements for other flammable oils The arrangements for the storage, distribution and utilization of other flammable oils employed under pressure in power transmission systems, control and activating systems and heating systems shall be such as to ensure the safety of the ship and persons on board. Suitable oil collecting arrangements for leaks shall be fitted below hydraulic valves and cylinders. In locations where means of ignition are present, such arrangements shall at least comply with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.5.3 and 2.2.6 and with the provisions of paragraphs 2.2.4 and 2.2.5.1 in respect of strength and construction.  

2.5 Arrangements for oil fuel in periodically unattended machinery spaces In addition to the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 to 2.4, the oil fuel and lubricating oil systems in a periodically unattended machinery space shall comply with the following: 

.1 where daily service oil fuel tanks are filled automatically, or by remote control, means shall be provided to prevent overflow spillages. Other equipment which treats flammable liquids automatically (e.g. oil fuel purifiers) which, whenever practicable, shall be installed in a special space reserved for purifiers and their heaters, shall have arrangements to prevent overflow spillages; and  

.2 where daily service oil fuel tanks or settling tanks are fitted with heating arrangements, a high temperature alarm shall be provided if the flashpoint of the oil fuel can be exceeded.     
###3 Arrangements for gaseous fuel for domestic purpose

Gaseous fuel systems used for domestic purposes shall be approved by the Administration. Storage of gas bottles shall be located on the open deck or in a well ventilated space which opens only to the open deck. 
###4 Miscellaneous items of ignition sources and ignitability

4.1 Electric radiators Electric radiators, if used, shall be fixed in position and so constructed as to reduce fire risks to a minimum. No such radiators shall be fitted with an element so exposed that clothing, curtains, or other similar materials can be scorched or set on fire by heat from the element.  

4.2 Waste receptacles Waste receptacles shall be constructed of non-combustible materials with no openings in the sides or bottom.  

4.3 Insulation surfaces protected against oil penetration In spaces where penetration of oil products is possible, the surface of insulation shall be impervious to oil or oil vapours.  

4.4 Primary deck coverings Primary deck coverings, if applied within accommodation and service spaces and control stations, or if applied on cabin balconies of passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 2008, shall be of approved material which will not readily ignite, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code.   
###5 Cargo areas of tankers

5.1 Separation of cargo oil tanks 

5.1.1 Cargo pump-rooms, cargo tanks, slop tanks and cofferdams shall be positioned forward of machinery spaces. However, oil fuel bunker tanks need not be forward of machinery spaces. Cargo tanks and slop tanks shall be isolated from machinery spaces by cofferdams, cargo pump-rooms, oil bunker tanks or ballast tanks. Pump-rooms containing pumps and their accessories for ballasting those spaces situated adjacent to cargo tanks and slop tanks and pumps for oil fuel transfer, shall be considered as equivalent to a cargo pump-room within the context of this regulation provided that such pump-rooms have the same safety standard as that required for cargo pump-rooms. Pump-rooms intended solely for ballast or oil fuel transfer, however, need not comply with the requirements of regulation 10.9. The lower portion of the pump-room may be recessed into machinery spaces of category A to accommodate pumps, provided that the deck head of the recess is in general not more than one third of the moulded depth above the keel, except that in the case of ships of not more than 25,000 tonnes deadweight, where it can be demonstrated that for reasons of access and satisfactory piping arrangements this is impracticable, the Administration may permit a recess in excess of such height, but not exceeding one half of the moulded depth above the keel.  

5.1.2 Main cargo control stations, control stations, accommodation and service spaces (excluding isolated cargo handling gear lockers) shall be positioned aft of cargo tanks, slop tanks, and spaces which isolate cargo or slop tanks from machinery spaces, but not necessarily aft of the oil fuel bunker tanks and ballast tanks, and shall be arranged in such a way that a single failure of a deck or bulkhead shall not permit the entry of gas or fumes from the cargo tanks into an accommodation space, main cargo control stations, control station, or service spaces. A recess provided in accordance with paragraph 5.1.1 need not be taken into account when the position of these spaces is being determined.  

5.1.3 However, where deemed necessary, the Administration may permit main cargo control stations, control stations, accommodation and service spaces forward of the cargo tanks, slop tanks and spaces which isolate cargo and slop tanks from machinery spaces, but not necessarily forward of oil fuel bunker tanks or ballast tanks. Machinery spaces, other than those of category A, may be permitted forward of the cargo tanks and slop tanks provided they are isolated from the cargo tanks and slop tanks by cofferdams, cargo pump-rooms, oil fuel bunker tanks or ballast tanks, and have at least one portable fire extinguisher. In cases where they contain internal combustion machinery, one approved foam-type extinguisher of at least 45 l capacity or equivalent shall be arranged in addition to portable fire extinguishers. If operation of a semi-portable fire extinguisher is impracticable, this fire extinguisher may be replaced by two additional portable fire extinguishers. Accommodation spaces, main cargo control spaces, control stations and service spaces shall be arranged in such a way that a single failure of a deck or bulkhead shall not permit the entry of gas or fumes from the cargo tanks into such spaces. In addition, where deemed necessary for the safety or navigation of the ship, the Administration may permit machinery spaces containing internal combustion machinery not being main propulsion machinery having an output greater than 375 kW to be located forward of the cargo area provided the arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.  

5.1.4 In combination carriers only: 

.1 The slop tanks shall be surrounded by cofferdams except where the boundaries of the slop tanks are part of the hull, main cargo deck, cargo pump-room bulkhead or oil fuel bunker tank. These cofferdams shall not be open to a double bottom, pipe tunnel, pump-room or other enclosed space, nor shall they be used for cargo or ballast and shall not be connected to piping systems serving oil cargo or ballast. Means shall be provided for filling the cofferdams with water and for draining them. Where the boundary of a slop tank is part of the cargo pump-room bulkhead, the pump-room shall not be open to the double bottom, pipe tunnel or other enclosed space; however, openings provided with gastight bolted covers may be permitted;  

.2 Means shall be provided for isolating the piping connecting the pump-room with the slop tanks referred to in paragraph 5.1.4.1. The means of isolation shall consist of a valve followed by a spectacle flange or a spool piece with appropriate blank flanges. This arrangement shall be located adjacent to the slop tanks, but where this is unreasonable or impracticable, it may be located within the pump-room directly after the piping penetrates the bulkhead. A separate permanently installed pumping and piping arrangement incorporating a manifold, provided with a shut-off valve and a blank flange, shall be provided for discharging the contents of the slop tanks directly to the open deck for disposal to shore reception facilities when the ship is in the dry cargo mode. When the transfer system is used for slop transfer in the dry cargo mode, it shall have no connection to other systems. Separation from other systems by means of removal of spool pieces may be accepted;  

.3 Hatches and tank cleaning openings to slop tanks shall only be permitted on the open deck and shall be fitted with closing arrangements. Except where they consist of bolted plates with bolts at watertight spacing, these closing arrangements shall be provided with locking arrangements under the control of the responsible ship's officer; and  

.4 Where cargo wing tanks are provided, cargo oil lines below deck shall be installed inside these tanks. However, the Administration may permit cargo oil lines to be placed in special ducts provided they are capable of being adequately cleaned and ventilated to the satisfaction of the Administration. Where cargo wing tanks are not provided, cargo oil lines below deck shall be placed in special ducts.    

5.1.5 Where the fitting of a navigation position above the cargo area is shown to be necessary, it shall be for navigation purposes only and it shall be separated from the cargo tank deck by means of an open space with a height of at least 2 m. The fire protection requirements for such a navigation position shall be that required for control stations, as specified in regulation 9.2.4.2 and other provisions for tankers, as applicable.  

5.1.6 Means shall be provided to keep deck spills away from the accommodation and service areas. This may be accomplished by provision of a permanent continuous coaming of a height of at least 300 mm, extending from side to side. Special consideration shall be given to the arrangements associated with stern loading.    

5.2 Restriction on boundary openings 

5.2.1 Except as permitted in paragraph 5.2.2, access doors, air inlets and openings to accommodation spaces, service spaces, control stations and machinery spaces shall not face the cargo area. They shall be located on the transverse bulkhead not facing the cargo area or on the outboard side of the superstructure or deckhouse at a distance of at least 4% of the length of the ship but not less than 3 m from the end of the superstructure or deckhouse facing the cargo area. This distance need not exceed 5 m.  

5.2.2 The Administration may permit access doors in boundary bulkheads facing the cargo area or within the 5 m limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1, to main cargo control stations and to such service spaces used as provision rooms, store-rooms and lockers, provided they do not give access directly or indirectly to any other space containing or providing for accommodation, control stations or service spaces such as galleys, pantries or workshops, or similar spaces containing sources of vapour ignition. The boundary of such a space shall be insulated to “A-60" standard, with the exception of the boundary facing the cargo area. Bolted plates for the removal of machinery may be fitted within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1. Wheelhouse doors and windows may be located within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1 so long as they are designed to ensure that the wheelhouse can be made rapidly and efficiently gas and vapour tight.  

5.2.3 Windows and sidescuttles facing the cargo area and on the sides of the superstructures and deckhouses within the limits specified in paragraph 5.2.1 shall be of the fixed (non-opening) type. Such windows and sidescuttles, except wheelhouse windows, shall be constructed to “A-60” class standard except that “A-0” class standard is acceptable for windows and sidescuttles outside the limit specified in regulation 9.2.4.2.5.  

5.2.4 Where there is permanent access from a pipe tunnel to the main pump-room, a watertight door shall be fitted complying with the requirements of regulation II-1/213-1.2 and, in addition, with the following: 

.1 in addition to the bridge operation, the watertight door shall be capable of being manually closed from outside the main pump-room entrance; and  

.2 the watertight door shall be kept closed during normal operations of the ship except when access to the pipe tunnel is required.    

5.2.5 Permanent approved gastight lighting enclosures for illuminating cargo pump-rooms may be permitted in bulkheads and decks separating cargo pump-rooms and other spaces provided they are of adequate strength and the integrity and gastightness of the bulkhead or deck is maintained.  

5.2.6 The arrangement of ventilation inlets and outlets and other deck-house and superstructure boundary space openings shall be such as to complement the provisions of paragraph 5.3 and regulation 11.6. Such vents, especially for machinery spaces, shall be situated as far aft as practicable. Due consideration in this regard shall be given when the ship is equipped to load or discharge at the stern. Sources of ignition such as electrical equipment shall be so arranged as to avoid an explosion hazard.    

5.3 Cargo tank venting 

5.3.1 General requirements The venting systems of cargo tanks are to be entirely distinct from the air pipes of the other compartments of the ship. The arrangements and position of openings in the cargo tank deck from which emission of flammable vapours can occur shall be such as to minimize the possibility of flammable vapours being admitted to enclosed spaces containing a source of ignition, or collecting in the vicinity of deck machinery and equipment which may constitute an ignition hazard. In accordance with this general principle, the criteria in paragraphs 5.3.2 to 5.3.5 and regulation 11.6 will apply.  

5.3.2 Venting arrangements 

5.3.2.1 The venting arrangements in each cargo tank may be independent or combined with other cargo tanks and may be incorporated into the inert gas piping.  

5.3.2.2 Where the arrangements are combined with other cargo tanks, either stop valves or other acceptable means shall be provided to isolate each cargo tank. Where stop valves are fitted, they shall be provided with locking arrangements which shall be under the control of the responsible ship's officer. There shall be a clear visual indication of the operational status of the valves or other acceptable means.

A fixed fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code shall be installed on cabin balconies of ships to which regulation 5.3.4 applies, when furniture and furnishings on such balconies are not as defined in regulations 3.40.1, 3.40.2, 3.40.3, 3.40.6 and 3.40.7.  

### Regulation  8  

####Control of smoke spread

###1 Purpose

The purpose of this regulation is to control the spread of smoke in order to minimize the hazards from smoke. For this purpose, means for controlling smoke in atriums, control stations, machinery spaces and concealed spaces shall be provided. 
###2. Protection of control stations outside machinery spaces

Practicable measures shall be taken for control stations outside machinery spaces in order to ensure that ventilation, visibility and freedom from smoke are maintained so that, in the event of fire, the machinery and equipment contained therein may be supervised and continue to function effectively. Alternative and separate means of air supply shall be provided and air inlets of the two sources of supply shall be so disposed that the risk of both inlets drawing in smoke simultaneously is minimized. At the discretion of the Administration, such requirements need not apply to control stations situated on, and opening on to, an open deck or where local closing arrangements would be equally effective. 
###3 Release of smoke from machinery spaces

3.1 The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to machinery spaces of category A and, where the Administration considers desirable, to other machinery spaces. 3.2 Suitable arrangements shall be made to permit the release of smoke, in the event of fire, from the space to be protected, subject to the provisions of regulation 9.5.2.1 The normal ventilation systems may be acceptable for this purpose. 3.3 Means of control shall be provided for permitting the release of smoke and such controls shall be located outside the space concerned so that, in the event of fire, they will not be cut off from the space they serve. 3.4 In passenger ships, the controls required by paragraph 3.3 shall be situated at one control position or grouped in as few positions as possible to the satisfaction of the Administration. Such positions shall have a safe access from the open deck. 
###4 Draught stops

Air spaces enclosed behind ceilings, panelling or linings shall be divided by close-fitting draught stops spaced not more than 14 m apart. In the vertical direction, such enclosed air spaces, including those behind linings of stairways, trunks, etc., shall be closed at each deck. 
###5 Smoke extraction systems in atriums of passenger ships

Atriums shall be equipped with a smoke extraction system. The smoke extraction system shall be activated by the required smoke detection system and be capable of manual control. The fans shall be sized such that the entire volume within space can be exhausted in 10 min or less.  

### Regulation  9  

####Containment of fire

###1 Purpose

The purpose of this regulation is to contain a fire in the space of origin. For this purpose, the following functional requirements shall be met: 

.1 the ship shall be subdivided by thermal and structural boundaries;  

.2 thermal insulation of boundaries shall have due regard to the fire risk of the space and adjacent spaces; and  

.3 the fire integrity of the divisions shall be maintained at openings and penetrations.   
###2. Thermal and structural boundaries

2.1 Thermal and structural subdivision Ships of all types shall be subdivided into spaces by thermal and structural divisions having regard to the fire risks of the space.  

2.2 Passenger ships 

2.2.1 Main vertical zones and horizontal zones 

2.2.1.1.1 In ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by “A-60” class divisions. Steps and recesses shall be kept to a minimum, but where they are necessary they shall also be “A-60” class divisions. Where a category (5), (9) or (10) space defined in paragraph 2.2.3.2.2 is on one side or where fuel oil tanks are on both sides of the division the standard may be reduced to “A-0”. 2.2.1.1.2 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, the hull, superstructure and deckhouses in way of accommodation and service spaces shall be subdivided into main vertical zones by “A” class divisions. These divisions shall have insulation values in accordance with tables in paragraph 2.2.4.  

2.2.1.2 As far as practicable, the bulkheads forming the boundaries of the main vertical zones above the bulkhead deck shall be in line with watertight subdivision bulkheads situated immediately below the bulkhead deck. The length and width of main vertical zones may be extended to a maximum of 48 m in order to bring the ends of main vertical zones to coincide with watertight subdivision bulkheads or in order to accommodate a large public space extending for the whole length of the main vertical zone provided that the total area of the main vertical zone is not greater than 1,600 m <sup>2</sup> on any deck. The length or width of a main vertical zone is the maximum distance between the furthermost points of the bulkheads bounding it.  

2.2.1.3 Such bulkheads shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries.  

2.2.1.4 Where a main vertical zone is subdivided by horizontal “A” class divisions into horizontal zones for the purpose of providing an appropriate barrier between a zone with sprinklers and a zone without sprinklers, the divisions shall extend between adjacent main vertical zone bulkheads and to the shell or exterior boundaries of the ship and shall be insulated in accordance with the fire insulation and integrity values given in table 9.4.  

2.2.1.5.1 On ships designed for special purposes, such as automobile or railroad car ferries, where the provision of main vertical zone bulkheads would defeat the purpose for which the ship is intended, equivalent means for controlling and limiting a fire shall be substituted and specifically approved by the Administration. Service spaces and ship stores shall not be located on ro-ro decks unless protected in accordance with the applicable regulations. 2.2.1.5.2 However, in a ship with special category spaces, such spaces shall comply with the applicable provisions of regulation 20 and where such compliance would be inconsistent with other requirements for passenger ships specified in this chapter, the requirements of regulation 20 shall prevail.    

2.2.2 Bulkheads within a main vertical zone 2.2.2.1 For ships carrying more than 36 passengers, bulkheads which are not required to be “A” class divisions shall be at least “B” class or “C” class divisions as prescribed in the tables in paragraph 2.2.3. 2.2.2.2 For ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, bulkheads within accommodation and service spaces which are not required to be “A” class divisions shall be at least “B” class or “C” class divisions as prescribed in the tables in paragraph 2.2.4. In addition, corridor bulkheads, where not required to be “A” class, shall be “B” class divisions which shall extend from deck to deck except: 

.1 when continuous “B” class ceilings or linings are fitted on both sides of the bulkhead, the portion of the bulkhead behind the continuous ceiling or lining shall be of material which, in thickness and composition, is acceptable in the construction of “B” class divisions, but which shall be required to meet “B” class integrity standards only in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration; and  

.2 in the case of a ship protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code, the corridor bulkheads may terminate at a ceiling in the corridor provided such bulkheads and ceilings are of “B” class standard in compliance with paragraph 2.2.4. All doors and frames in such bulkheads shall be of non-combustible materials and shall have the same fire integrity as the bulkhead in which they are fitted.   2.2.2.3 Bulkheads required to be “B” class divisions, except corridor bulkheads as prescribed in paragraph 2.2.2.2, shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries. However, where a continuous “B” class ceiling or lining is fitted on both sides of a bulkhead which is at least of the same fire resistance as the adjoining bulkhead, the bulkhead may terminate at the continuous ceiling or lining.  

2.2.3 Fire integrity of bulkheads and decks in ships carrying more than 36 passengers 

2.2.3.1 In addition to complying with the specific provisions for fire integrity of bulkheads and decks of passenger ships, the minimum fire integrity of all bulkheads and decks shall be as prescribed in tables 9.1 and 9.2. Where, due to any particular structural arrangements in the ship, difficulty is experienced in determining from the tables the minimum fire integrity value of any divisions, such values shall be determined to the satisfaction of the Administration.  

2.2.3.2 The following requirements shall govern application of the tables: 

.1 Table 9.1 shall apply to bulkheads not bounding either main vertical zones or horizontal zones. Table 9.2 shall apply to decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones;  

.2 For determining the appropriate fire integrity standards to be applied to boundaries between adjacent spaces, such spaces are classified according to their fire risk as shown in categories (1) to (14) below. Where the contents and use of a space are such that there is a doubt as to its classification for the purpose of this regulation, or where it is possible to assign two or more classifications to a space, it shall be treated as a space within the relevant category having the most stringent boundary requirements. Smaller, enclosed rooms within a space that have less than 30% communicating openings to that space are considered separate spaces. The fire integrity of the boundary bulkheads and decks of such smaller rooms shall be as prescribed in tables 9.1 and 9.2.

Note: To be applied to tables 9.1 and 9.2. 

<sup>a</sup> Where adjacent spaces are in the same numerical category and superscript “a” appears, a bulkhead or deck between such spaces need not be fitted if deemed unnecessary by the Administration. For example, in category (12) a bulkhead need not be required between a galley and its annexed pantries provided the pantry bulkhead and decks maintain the integrity of the galley boundaries. A bulkhead is, however, required between a galley and machinery space even though both spaces are in category (12).  

<sup>b</sup> The ship's side, to the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition, superstructure and deckhouse sides situated below and adjacent to liferafts and evacuation slides may be reduced to “A-30”.  

<sup>c</sup> Where public toilets are installed completely within the stairway enclosure, the public toilet bulkhead within the stairway enclosure can be of “B” class integrity.  

<sup>d</sup> Where spaces of categories (6), (7), (8) and (9) are located completely within the outer perimeter of the assembly station, the bulkheads of these spaces are allowed to be of “B-0” class integrity. Control positions for audio, video and light installations may be considered as part of the assembly station.    

2.2.3.3 Continuous “B” class ceilings or linings, in association with the relevant decks or bulkheads, may be accepted as contributing wholly or in part, to the required insulation and integrity of a division.  

2.2.3.4 Construction and arrangement of saunas 

2.2.3.4.1 The perimeter of the sauna shall be of “A” class boundaries and may include changing rooms, showers and toilets. The sauna shall be insulated to A-60 standard against other spaces except those inside of the perimeter and spaces of categories (5), (9) and (10).  

2.2.3.4.2 Bathrooms with direct access to saunas may be considered as part of them. In such cases, the door between sauna and the bathroom need not comply with fire safety requirements.  

2.2.3.4.3 The traditional wooden lining on the bulkheads and ceiling are permitted in the sauna. The ceiling above the oven shall be lined with a non-combustible plate with an air gap of at least 30 mm. The distance from the hot surfaces to combustible materials shall be at least 500 mm or the combustible materials shall be protected (e.g. non-combustible plate with an air gap of at least 30 mm).  

2.2.3.4.4 The traditional wooden benches are permitted to be used in the sauna.  

2.2.3.4.5 The sauna door shall open outwards by pushing.  

2.2.3.4.6 Electrically heated ovens shall be provided with a timer.      

2.2.4 Fire integrity of bulkheads and decks in ships carrying not more than 36 passengers 

2.2.4.1 In addition to complying with the specific provisions for fire integrity of bulkheads and decks of passenger ships, the minimum fire integrity of bulkheads and decks shall be as prescribed in tables 9.3 and 9.4.  

2.2.4.2 The following requirements govern application of the tables: 

.1 Tables 9.3 and 9.4 shall apply respectively to the bulkheads and decks separating adjacent spaces;  

.2 For determining the appropriate fire integrity standards to be applied to divisions between adjacent spaces, such spaces are classified according to their fire risk as shown in categories (1) to (11) below. Where the contents and use of a space are such that there is a doubt as to its classification for the purpose of this regulation, or where it is possible to assign two or more classifications to a space, it shall be treated as a space within the relevant category having the most stringent boundary requirements. Smaller, enclosed rooms within a space that have less than 30 % communicating openings to that space are considered separate spaces. The fire integrity of the boundary bulkheads and decks of such smaller rooms shall be as prescribed in tables 9.3 and 9.4. The title of each category is intended to be typical rather than restrictive. The number in parentheses preceding each category refers to the applicable column or row in the tables. 

(1) Control stations Spaces containing emergency sources of power and lighting. Wheelhouse and chartroom. Spaces containing the ship's radio equipment. Fire control stations. Control room for propulsion machinery when located outside the machinery space. Spaces containing centralized fire alarm equipment.  

(2) Corridors Passenger and crew corridors and lobbies.  

(3) Accommodation spaces Spaces as defined in regulation 3.1 excluding corridors.  

(4) Stairways Interior stairways, lifts, totally enclosed emergency escape trunks, and escalators (other than those wholly contained within the machinery spaces) and enclosures thereto. In this connection, a stairway which is enclosed only at one level shall be regarded as part of the space from which it is not separated by a fire door.  

(5) Service spaces (low risk) Lockers and store-rooms not having provisions for the storage of flammable liquids and having areas less than 4 m <sup>2</sup> and drying rooms and laundries.  

(6) Machinery spaces of category A Spaces as defined in regulation 3.31.  

(7) Other machinery spaces Electrical equipment rooms (auto-telephone exchange, air-conditioning duct spaces). Spaces as defined in regulation 3.30 excluding machinery spaces of category A.  

(8) Cargo spaces All spaces used for cargo (including cargo oil tanks) and trunkways and hatchways to such spaces, other than special category spaces.  

(9) Service spaces (high risk) Galleys, pantries containing cooking appliances, paint and lamp rooms, lockers and store-rooms having areas of 4 m <sup>2</sup> or more, spaces for the storage of flammable liquids, saunas and workshops other than those forming part of the machinery spaces.  

(10) Open decks Open deck spaces and enclosed promenades having little or no fire risk. To be considered in this category, enclosed promenades should have no significant fire risk, meaning that furnishing should be restricted to deck furniture. In addition, such spaces should be naturally ventilated by permanent openings. Air spaces (the space outside superstructures and deckhouses).  

(11) Special category and ro-ro spaces Spaces as defined in regulations 3.41 and 3.46;    

.3 In determining the applicable fire integrity standard of a boundary between two spaces within a main vertical zone or horizontal zone which is not protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code or between such zones neither of which is so protected, the higher of the two values given in the tables shall apply;  

.4 In determining the applicable fire integrity standard of a boundary between two spaces within a main vertical zone or horizontal zone which is protected by an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code or between such zones both of which are so protected, the lesser of the two values given in the tables shall apply. Where a zone with sprinklers and a zone without sprinklers meet within accommodation and service spaces, the higher of the two values given in the tables shall apply to the division between the zones.    

2.2.4.3 Continuous “B” class ceilings or linings, in association with the relevant decks or bulkheads, may be accepted as contributing, wholly or in part, to the required insulation and integrity of a division.  

2.2.4.4 External boundaries which are required in regulation 11.2 to be of steel or other equivalent material may be pierced for the fitting of windows and sidescuttles provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries of passenger ships to have “A” class integrity. Similarly, in such boundaries which are not required to have “A” class integrity, doors may be constructed of materials which are to the satisfaction of the Administration.

Notes: To be applied to both tables 9.3 and 9.4 as appropriate. 

<sup>a</sup> For clarification as to which applies, see paragraphs 2.2.2 and 2.2.5.  

<sup>b</sup> Where spaces are of the same numerical category and superscript b appears, a bulkhead or deck of the rating shown in the tables is only required when the adjacent spaces are for a different purpose, (e.g. in category (9)). A galley next to a galley does not require a bulkhead but a galley next to a paint room requires an “A-0” bulkhead.  

<sup>c</sup> Bulkhead separating the wheelhouse and chartroom from each other may have a “B-0” rating.  

<sup>d</sup> See paragraphs 2.2.4.2.3 and 2.2.4.2.4.  

<sup>e</sup> For the application of paragraph 2.2.1.1.2, “B-0” and “C”, where appearing in table 9.3, shall be read as “A-0”.  

<sup>f</sup> Fire insulation need not be fitted if the machinery space in category (7), in the opinion of the Administration, has little or no fire risk.   * Where an asterisk appears in the tables, the division is required to be of steel or other equivalent material, but is not required to be of “A” class standard. However, where a deck, except in a category (10) space, is penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes and vent ducts, such penetrations should be made tight to prevent the passage of flame and smoke. Divisions between control stations (emergency generators) and open decks may have air intake openings without means for closure, unless a fixed gas fire-fighting system is fitted. For the application of paragraph 2.2.1.1.2, an asterisk, where appearing in table 9.4, except for categories (8) and (10), shall be read as “A-0”.    

2.2.5 Protection of stairways and lifts in accommodation area 

2.2.5.1 Stairways shall be within enclosures formed of “A” class divisions, with positive means of closure at all openings, except that: 

.1 a stairway connecting only two decks need not be enclosed, provided the integrity of the deck is maintained by proper bulkheads or self-closing doors in one 'tween-deck space. When a stairway is closed in one 'tween-deck space, the stairway enclosure shall be protected in accordance with the tables for decks in paragraphs 2.2.3 or 2.2.4; and  

.2 stairways may be fitted in the open in a public space, provided they lie wholly within the public space.    

2.2.5.2 Lift trunks shall be so fitted as to prevent the passage of smoke and flame from one `tween-deck to another and shall be provided with means of closing so as to permit the control of draught and smoke. Machinery for lifts located within stairway enclosures shall be arranged in a separate room, surrounded by steel boundaries, except that small passages for lift cables are permitted. Lifts which open into spaces other than corridors, public spaces, special category spaces, stairways and external areas shall not open into stairways included in the means of escape.    

2.2.6. *Arrangement of cabin balconies* On passenger ships constructed on or after 1 July 2008, non-load bearing partial bulkheads which separate adjacent cabin balconies shall be capable of being opened by the crew from each side for the purpose of fighting fires.    

2.3 Cargo ships except tankers 

2.3.1 Methods of protection in accommodation area 

2.3.1.1 One of the following methods of protection shall be adopted in accommodation and service spaces and control stations: 

.1 Method IC The construction of internal divisional bulkheads of non-combustible “B” or “C” class divisions generally without the installation of an automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system in the accommodation and service spaces, except as required by regulation 7.5.5.1; or  

.2 Method IIC The fitting of an automatic sprinkler, fire detection and fire alarm system as required by regulation 7.5.5.2 for the detection and extinction of fire in all spaces in which fire might be expected to originate, generally with no restriction on the type of internal divisional bulkheads; or  

.3 Method IIIC The fitting of a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system as required by Regulation 7.5.5.3, in spaces in which a fire might be expected to originate, generally with no restriction on the type of internal divisional bulkheads, except that in no case must the area of any accommodation space or spaces bounded by an “A” or “B” class division exceed 50 m <sup>2</sup>. Consideration may be given by the Administration to increasing this area for public spaces.    

2.3.1.2 The requirements for the use of non-combustible materials in the construction and insulation of boundary bulkheads of machinery spaces, control stations, service spaces, etc., and the protection of the above stairway enclosures and corridors will be common to all three methods outlined in paragraph 2.3.1.1.    

2.3.2 Bulkheads within accommodation area 

2.3.2.1 Bulkheads required to be “B” class divisions shall extend from deck to deck and to the shell or other boundaries. However, where a continuous “B” class ceiling or lining is fitted on both sides of the bulkhead, the bulkhead may terminate at the continuous ceiling or lining.  

2.3.2.2 Method IC Bulkheads not required by this or other regulations for cargo ships to be “A” or “B” class divisions, shall be of at least “C” class construction.  

2.3.2.3 Method IIC There shall be no restriction on the construction of bulkheads not required by this or other Regulations for cargo ships to be “A” or “B” class divisions except in individual cases where “C” class bulkheads are required in accordance with table 9.5.  

2.3.2.4 Method IIIC There shall be no restriction on the construction of bulkheads not required for cargo ships to be “A” or “B” class divisions except that the area of any accommodation space or spaces bounded by a continuous “A” or “B” class division must in no case exceed 50 m <sup>2</sup>, except in individual cases where “C” class bulkheads are required in accordance with table 9.5. Consideration may be given by the Administration to increasing this area for public spaces.    

2.3.3 Fire integrity of bulkheads and decks 

2.3.3.1 In addition to complying with the specific provisions for fire integrity of bulkheads and decks of cargo ships, the minimum fire integrity of bulkheads and decks shall be as prescribed in tables 9.5 and 9.6.  

2.3.3.2 The following requirements shall govern application of the tables: 

.1 Tables 9.5 and 9.6 shall apply respectively to the bulkheads and decks separating adjacent spaces;  

.2 For determining the appropriate fire integrity standards to be applied to divisions between adjacent spaces, such spaces are classified according to their fire risk as shown in categories (1) to (11) below. Where the contents and use of a space are such that there is a doubt as to its classification for the purpose of this regulation, or where it is possible to assign two or more classifications to a space, it shall be treated as a space within the relevant category having the most stringent boundary requirements. Smaller, enclosed rooms within a space that have less than 30% communicating openings to that space are considered separate spaces. The fire integrity of the boundary bulkheads and decks of such smaller rooms shall be as prescribed in tables 9.5 and 9.6. The title of each category is intended to be typical rather than restrictive. The number in parentheses preceding each category refers to the applicable column or row in the tables;   

(1) Control stations Spaces containing emergency sources of power and lighting. Wheelhouse and chartroom. Spaces containing the ship's radio equipment. Fire control stations. Control room for propulsion machinery when located outside the machinery space. Spaces containing centralized fire alarm equipment.  

(2) Corridors Corridors and lobbies.  

(3) Accommodation spaces Spaces as defined in regulation 3.1, excluding corridors.  

(4) Stairways Interior stairway, lifts, totally enclosed emergency escape trunks, and escalators (other than those wholly contained within the machinery spaces) and enclosures thereto. In this connection, a stairway which is enclosed only at one level shall be regarded as part of the space from which it is not separated by a fire door.  

(5) Service spaces (low risk) Lockers and store-rooms not having provisions for the storage of flammable liquids and having areas less than 4 m <sup>2</sup> and drying rooms and laundries.  

(6) Machinery spaces of category A Spaces as defined in regulation 3.31.  

(7) Other machinery spaces Electrical equipment rooms (auto-telephone exchange, air-conditioning duct spaces). Spaces as defined in regulation 3.30 excluding machinery spaces of category A.  

(8) Cargo spaces All spaces used for cargo (including cargo oil tanks) and trunkways and hatchways to such spaces.  

(9) Service spaces (high risk) Galleys, pantries containing cooking appliances, saunas, paint lockers and store-rooms having areas of 4 m <sup>2</sup> or more, spaces for the storage of flammable liquids, and workshops other than those forming part of the machinery spaces.  

(10) Open decks Open deck spaces and enclosed promenades having little or no fire risk. To be considered in this category, enclosed promenades shall have no significant fire risk, meaning that furnishings shall be restricted to deck furniture. In addition, such spaces shall be naturally ventilated by permanent openings. Air spaces (the space outside superstructures and deckhouses).  

(11) Ro-ro and vehicle spaces Ro-ro spaces as defined in regulation 3.41. Vehicle spaces as defined in regulation 3.49.    *Table 9.5 – Fire integrity of bulkheads separating adjacent spaces*

Notes: To be applied to tables 9.5 and 9.6 as appropriate. 

<sup>a</sup> No special requirements are imposed upon bulkheads in methods IIC and IIIC fire protection.  

<sup>b</sup> In case of method IIIC “B” class bulkheads of “B-0” rating shall be provided between spaces or groups of spaces of 50 m <sup>2</sup> and over in area.  

<sup>c</sup> For clarification as to which applies, see paragraphs 2.3.2 and 2.3.4.  

<sup>d</sup> Where spaces are of the same numerical category and superscript d appear, a bulkhead or deck of the rating shown in the tables is only required when the adjacent spaces are for a different purpose (e.g. in category (9)). A galley next to a galley does not require a bulkhead but a galley next to a paint room requires an “A-0” bulkhead.  

<sup>e</sup> Bulkheads separating the wheelhouse, chartroom and radio room from each other may have a “B-0” rating.  

<sup>f</sup> An “A-0” rating may be used if no dangerous goods are intended to be carried or if such goods are stowed not less than 3 m horizontally from such a bulkhead.  

<sup>g</sup> For cargo spaces in which dangerous goods are intended to be carried, regulation 19.3.8 applies.  

<sup>h</sup> Bulkheads and decks separating ro-ro spaces shall be capable of being closed reasonably gastight and such divisions shall have “A” class integrity in so far as reasonable and practicable, if in the opinion of the Administration it has little or no fire risk.  

<sup>i</sup> Fire insulation need not be fitted if the machinery in category (7) if, in the opinion of the Administration, it has little or no fire risk. * Where an asterisk appears in the tables, the division is required to be of steel or other equivalent material but is not required to be of “A” class standard. However, where a deck, except an open deck, is penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes and vent ducts, such penetrations should be made tight to prevent the passage of flame and smoke. Divisions between control stations (emergency generators) and open decks may have air intake openings without means for closure, unless a fixed gas fire-fighting system is fitted.    

2.3.3.3 Continuous “B” class ceilings or linings, in association with the relevant decks or bulkheads, may be accepted as contributing, wholly or in part, to the required insulation and integrity of a division.  

2.3.3.4 External boundaries which are required in regulation 11.2 to be of steel or other equivalent material may be pierced for the fitting of windows and sidescuttles provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries of cargo ships to have “A” class integrity. Similarly, in such boundaries which are not required to have “A” class integrity, doors may be constructed of materials which are to the satisfaction of the Administration.  

2.3.3.5 Saunas shall comply with paragraph 2.2.3.4.    

2.3.4 Protection of stairways and lift trunks in accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations 

2.3.4.1 Stairways which penetrate only a single deck shall be protected, at a minimum, at one level by at least “B-0” class divisions and self-closing doors. Lifts which penetrate only a single deck shall be surrounded by “A-0” class divisions with steel doors at both levels. Stairways and lift trunks which penetrate more than a single deck shall be surrounded by at least “A-0” class divisions and be protected by self-closing doors at all levels.  

2.3.4.2 On ships having accommodation for 12 persons or less, where stairways penetrate more than a single deck and where there are at least two escape routes direct to the open deck at every accommodation level, the “A-0” requirements of paragraph 2.3.4.1 may be reduced to “B-0”.      

2.4 Tankers 

2.4.1 Application For tankers, only method IC as defined in paragraph 2.3.1.1 shall be used.  

2.4.2 Fire integrity of bulkheads and decks 

2.4.2.1 In lieu of paragraph 2.3 and in addition to complying with the specific provisions for fire integrity of bulkheads and decks of tankers, the minimum fire integrity of bulkheads and decks shall be as prescribed in tables 9.7 and 9.8.  

2.4.2.2 The following requirements shall govern application of the tables:

(10) Open decks Open deck spaces and enclosed promenades having little or no fire risk. To be considered in this category, enclosed promenades shal have no significant fire risk, meaning that furnishings shall be restricted to deck furniture. In addition, such spaces shall be naturally ventilated by permanent openings. Air spaces (the space outside superstructures and deckhouses).    

2.4.2.3 Continuous “B” class ceilings or linings, in association with the relevant decks or bulkheads, may be accepted as contributing, wholly or in part, to the required insulation and integrity of a division.  

2.4.2.4 External boundaries which are required in regulation 11.2 to be of steel or other equivalent material may be pierced for the fitting of windows and sidescuttles provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries of tankers to have “A” class integrity. Similarly, in such boundaries which are not required to have “A” class integrity, doors may be constructed of materials which are to the satisfaction of the Administration.  

2.4.2.5 Exterior boundaries of superstructures and deckhouses enclosing accommodation and including any overhanging decks which support such accommodation, shall be constructed of steel and insulated to “A-60” standard for the whole of the portions which face the cargo area and on the outward sides for a distance of 3 m from the end boundary facing the cargo area. The distance of 3 m shall be measured horizontally and parallel to the middle line of the ship from the boundary which faces the cargo area at each deck level.

Notes: To be applied to tables 9.7 and 9.8 as appropriate. 

<sup>a</sup> For clarification as to which applies, see paragraphs 2.3.2 and 2.3.4.  

<sup>b</sup> Where spaces are of the same numerical category and superscript b appears, a bulkhead or deck of the rating shown in the tables is only required when the adjacent spaces are for a different purpose (e.g. in category (9)). A galley next to a galley does not require a bulkhead but a galley next to a paint room requires an “A-0” bulkhead.  

<sup>c</sup> Bulkheads separating the wheelhouse, chartroom and radio room from each other may have a “B-0” rating.  

<sup>d</sup> Bulkheads and decks between cargo pump-rooms and machinery spaces of category A may be penetrated by cargo pump shaft glands and similar gland penetrations, provided that gas tight seals with efficient lubrication or other means of ensuring the permanence of the gas seal are fitted in way of the bulkheads or deck.  

<sup>e</sup> Fire insulation need not be fitted if the machinery space in category (7) if, in the opinion of the Administration, it has little or no fire risk.   * Where an asterisk appears in the table, the division is required to be of steel or other equivalent material, but is not required to be of “A” class standard. However, where a deck, except an open deck, is penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes and vent ducts, such penetrations should be made tight to prevent the passage of flame and smoke. Divisions between control stations (emergency generators) and open decks may have air intake openings without means for closure, unless a fixed gas fire-fighting system is fitted.   
###3 Penetration in fire-resisting divisions and prevention of heat transmission

3.1 Where “A” class divisions are penetrated, such penetrations shall be tested in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4.1.1.5. In the case of ventilation ducts, paragraphs 7.1.2 and 7.3.1 apply. However, where a pipe penetration is made of steel or equivalent material having a thickness of 3mm or greater and a length of not less than 900 mm (preferably 450 mm on each side of the division), and no openings, testing is not required. Such penetrations shall be suitably insulated by extension of the insulation at the same level of the division.  

3.2 Where “B” class divisions are penetrated for the passage of electric cables, pipes, trunks, ducts, etc., or for the fitting of ventilation terminals, lighting fixtures and similar devices, arrangements shall be made to ensure that the fire resistance is not impaired, subject to the provisions of paragraph 7.3.2. Pipes other than steel or copper that penetrate “B” class divisions shall be protected by either: 

.1 a fire tested penetration device, suitable for the fire resistance of the division pierced and the type of pipe used; or  

.2 a steel sleeve, having a thickness of not less than 1.8 mm and a length of not less than 900 mm for pipe diameters of 150 mm or more and not less than 600 mm for pipe diameters of less than 150 mm (preferably equally divided to each side of the division). The pipe shall be connected to the ends of the sleeve by flanges or couplings; or the clearance between the sleeve and the pipe shall not exceed 2.5 mm; or any clearance between pipe and sleeve shall be made tight by means of non-combustible or other suitable material.    

3.3 Uninsulated metallic pipes penetrating “A” or “B” class divisions shall be of materials having a melting temperature which exceeds 950°C for “A-0” and 850°C for “B-0” class divisions.  

3.4 In approving structural fire protection details, the Administration shall have regard to the risk of heat transmission at intersections and terminal points of required thermal barriers. The insulation of a deck or bulkhead shall be carried past the penetration, intersection or terminal point for a distance of at least 450 mm in the case of steel and aluminium structures. If a space is divided with a deck or a bulkhead of “A” class standard having insulation of different values, the insulation with the higher value shall continue on the deck or bulkhead with the insulation of the lesser value for a distance of at least 450 mm.

.11 a door designed to re-open upon contacting an object in its path shall re-open not more than 1 m from the point of contact;  

.12 double-leaf doors equipped with a latch necessary for their fire integrity shall have a latch that is automatically activated by the operation of the doors when released by the system;  

.13 doors giving direct access to special category spaces which are power-operated and automatically closed need not be equipped with the alarms and remote-release mechanisms required in paragraphs 4.1.1.4.3 and 4.1.1.4.10;  

.14 the components of the local control system shall be accessible for maintenance and adjusting;  

.15 power-operated doors shall be provided with a control system of an approved type which shall be able to operate in case of fire and be in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code. This system shall satisfy the following requirements:  

.15.1 the control system shall be able to operate the door at the temperature of at least 200°C for at least 60 min, served by the power supply;  

.15.2 the power supply for all other doors not subject to fire shall not be impaired; and  

.15.3 at temperatures exceeding 200°C the control system shall be automatically isolated from the power supply and shall be capable of keeping the door closed up to at least 945°C.    

4.1.1.6 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, where a space is protected by an automatic sprinkler fire detection and alarm system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code or fitted with a continuous “B” class ceiling, openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the “A” class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration.  

4.1.1.7 The requirements for “A” class integrity of the outer boundaries of a ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows and sidescuttles, provided that there is no requirement for such boundaries to have “A” class integrity in paragraph 4.1.3.3. The requirements for “A” class integrity of the outer boundaries of the ship shall not apply to exterior doors, except for those in superstructures and deckhouses facing lifesaving appliances, embarkation and external assembly station areas, external stairs and open decks used for escape routes. Stairway enclosure doors need not meet this requirement.  

4.1.1.8 Except for watertight doors, weathertight doors (semi-watertight doors), doors leading to the open deck and doors which need to be reasonably gastight, all “A” class doors located in stairways, public spaces and main vertical zone bulkheads in escape routes shall be equipped with a self-closing hose port of material, construction and fire resistance which is equivalent to the door into which it is fitted, and shall be a 150 mm square clear opening with the door closed and shall be inset into the lower edge of the door, opposite the door hinges or, in the case of sliding doors, nearest the opening.  

4.1.1.9 Where it is necessary that a ventilation duct passes through a main vertical zone division, a fail-safe automatic closing fire damper shall be fitted adjacent to the division. The damper shall also be capable of being manually closed from each side of the division. The operating position shall be readily accessible and be marked in red light-reflecting colour. The duct between the division and the damper shall be of steel or other equivalent material and, if necessary, insulated to comply with the requirements of paragraph 3.1. The damper shall be fitted on at least one side of the division with a visible indicator showing whether the damper is in the open position.    

4.1.2 Openings in “B” class divisions 

4.1.2.1 Doors and door frames in “B” class divisions and means of securing them shall provide a method of closure which shall have resistance to fire equivalent to that of the divisions, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedure Code except that ventilation openings may be permitted in the lower portion of such doors. Where such opening is in or under a door the total net area of any such opening or openings shall not exceed 0.05 m <sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, a non-combustible air balance duct routed between the cabin and the corridor, and located below the sanitary unit is permitted where the cross-sectional area of the duct does not exceed 0.05 m <sup>2</sup>. All ventilation openings shall be fitted with a grill made of non-combustible material. Doors shall be non-combustible. Doors approved without the sill being part of the frame, which are installed on or after 1 July 2010, shall be installed such that the gap under the door does not exceed 12 mm. A non-combustible sill shall be installed under the door such that floor coverings do not extend beneath the closed door. Doors approved without the sill being part of the frame, which are installed on or after 1 July 2010, shall be installed such that the gap under the door does not exceed 25 mm.  

4.1.2.2 Cabin doors in “B” class divisions shall be of a self-closing type. Hold-back hooks are not permitted.  

4.1.2.3 The requirements for “B” class integrity of the outer boundaries of a ship shall not apply to glass partitions, windows and sidescuttles. Similarly, the requirements for “B” class integrity shall not apply to exterior doors in superstructures and deckhouses. For ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, the Administration may permit the use of combustible materials in doors separating cabins from the individual interior sanitary spaces such as showers.  

4.1.2.4 In ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, where an automatic sprinkler system complying with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code is fitted: 

.1 openings in decks not forming steps in main vertical zones nor bounding horizontal zones shall be closed reasonably tight and such decks shall meet the “B” class integrity requirements in so far as is reasonable and practicable in the opinion of the Administration; and  

.2 openings in corridor bulkheads of “B” class materials shall be protected in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.2.2.      

4.1.3 Windows and sidescuttles 

4.1.3.1 Windows and sidescuttles in bulkheads within accommodation and service spaces and control stations other than those to which the provisions of paragraph 4.1.1.6 and of paragraph 4.1.2.3 apply, shall be so constructed as to preserve the integrity requirements of the type of bulkheads in which they are fitted, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code.  

4.1.3.2 Notwithstanding the requirements of tables 9.1 to 9.4, windows and sidescuttles in bulkheads separating accommodation and service spaces and control stations from weather shall be constructed with frames of steel or other suitable material. The glass shall be retained by a metal glazing bead or angle.  

4.1.3.3 Windows facing life-saving appliances, embarkation and assembly stations, external stairs and open decks used for escape routes, and windows situated below liferaft and escape slide embarkation areas shall have fire integrity as required in table 9.1. Where automatic dedicated sprinkler heads are provided for windows, “A-0” windows may be accepted as equivalent. To be considered under this paragraph, the sprinkler heads shall either be: 

.1 dedicated heads located above the windows, and installed in addition to the conventional ceiling sprinklers; or  

.2 conventional ceiling sprinkler heads arranged such that the window is protected by an average application rate of at least 5 l/min per square metre and the additional window area is included in the calculation of the area of coverage; or  

.3 water-mist nozzles that have been tested and approved in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Organization . <sup> 1)  Refer to the Revised Guidelines for approval of sprinkler systems equivalent to that referred to in SOLAS regulation II-2/12 (resolution A.800(19)).  </sup>   Windows located in the ship's side below the lifeboat embarkation area shall have fire integrity at least equal to “A-0” class.      

4.2 Doors in fire-resisting divisions in cargo ships 

4.2.1 The fire resistance of doors shall be equivalent to that of the division in which they are fitted, this being determined in accordance with the Fire Test Procedures Code. Doors approved as “A” class without the sill being part of the frame, which are installed on or after 1 July 2010, shall be installed such that the gap under the door does not exceed 12 mm and a non-combustible sill shall be installed under the door such that floor coverings do not extend beneath the closed door. Doors approved as “B” class without the sill being part of the frame, which are installed on or after 1 July 2010, shall be installed such that the gap under the door does not exceed 25 mm. Doors and door frames in “A” class divisions shall be constructed of steel. Doors in “B” class divisions shall be non-combustible. Doors fitted in boundary bulkheads of machinery spaces of category A shall be reasonably gastight and self-closing. In ships constructed according to method IC, the Administration may permit the use of combustible materials in doors separating cabins from individual interior sanitary accommodation such as showers.  

4.2.2 Doors required to be self-closing shall not be fitted with hold-back hooks. However, hold-back arrangements fitted with remote release devices of the fail-safe type may be utilized.  

4.2.3 In corridor bulkheads ventilation openings may be permitted in and under the doors of cabins and public spaces. Ventilation openings are also permitted in “B” class doors leading to lavatories, offices, pantries, lockers and store-rooms. Except as permitted below, the openings shall be provided only in the lower half of a door. Where such an opening is in or under a door the total net area of any such opening or openings shall not exceed 0.05 m <sup>2</sup>. Alternatively, a non-combustible air balance duct routed between the cabin and the corridor, and located below the sanitary unit is permitted where the cross-sectional area of the duct does not exceed 0.05 m <sup>2</sup>. Ventilation openings, except those under the door, shall be fitted with a grille made of non-combustible material.  

4.2.4 Watertight doors need not be insulated.     
###5 Protection of openings in machinery spaces boundaries

5.1 Application 

5.1.1 The provision of this paragraph shall apply to machinery spaces of category A and, where the Administration considers it desirable, to other machinery spaces.    

5.2 Protection of openings in machinery space boundaries 

5.2.1 The number of skylights, doors, ventilators, openings in funnels to permit exhaust ventilation and other openings to machinery spaces shall be reduced to a minimum consistent with the needs of ventilation and the proper and safe working of the ship.  

5.2.2 Skylights shall be of steel and shall not contain glass panels.  

5.2.3 Means of control shall be provided for closing power-operated doors or actuating release mechanisms on doors other than power-operated watertight doors. The control shall be located outside the space concerned, where they will not be cut off in the event of fire in the space it serves.  

5.2.4 In passenger ships, the means of control required in paragraph 5.2.3 shall be situated at one control position or grouped in as few positions as possible to the satisfaction of the Administration. Such positions shall have safe access from the open deck.  

5.2.5 In passenger ships, doors, other than power-operated watertight doors shall be so arranged that positive closure is assured in case of fire in the space by power-operated closing arrangements or by the provision of self-closing doors capable of closing against an inclination of 3.5° opposing closure, and having a fail-safe hold-back arrangement, provided with a remotely operated release device. Doors for emergency escape trunks need not be fitted with a fail-safe hold-back facility and a remotely operated release device.  

5.2.6 Windows shall not be fitted in machinery space boundaries. However, this does not preclude the use of glass in control rooms within the machinery spaces.     
###6 Protection of cargo space boundaries

6.1 In passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the boundary bulkheads and decks of special category and ro-ro spaces shall be insulated to “A-60” class standard. However, where a category (5), (9) and (10) space, as defined in paragraph 2.2.3, is on one side of the division the standard may be reduced to “A-0”. Where fuel oil tanks are below a special category space, the integrity of the deck between such spaces may be reduced to “A-0” standard.  

6.2 In passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, the boundary bulkheads of special category spaces shall be insulated as required for category (11) spaces in table 9.4.  

6.3 In passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers the boundary bulkheads and decks of closed and open ro-ro spaces shall have a fire integrity as required for category (8) spaces in table 9.3 and the horizontal boundaries as required for category (8) spaces in table 9.4.

7.2 Arrangement of ducts 

7.2.1 The ventilation systems for machinery spaces of category A, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces, galleys, special category spaces and cargo spaces shall, in general, be separated from each other and from the ventilation systems serving other spaces. Except that the galley ventilation systems on cargo ships of less than 4,000 gross tonnage and in passenger ships carrying not more than 36 passengers, need not be completely separated, but may be served by separate ducts from a ventilation unit serving other spaces. In any case, an automatic fire damper shall be fitted in the galley ventilation duct near the ventilation unit. Ducts provided for the ventilation of machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces shall not pass through accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations unless they comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs 7.2.1.1.1 to 7.2.1.1.4 or 7.2.1.2.1 and 7.2.1.2.2 below:

.1.2 the ducts are suitably supported and stiffened;  

.1.3 the ducts are fitted with automatic fire dampers close to the boundaries penetrated; and  

.1.4 the ducts are insulated to “A-60” class standard from the machinery spaces, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces to a point at least 5 m beyond each fire damper; or  

.2.1 the ducts are constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.1.1.1 and 7.2.1.1.2; and  

.2.2 the ducts are insulated to “A-60” class standard throughout the accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations; except that penetrations of main zone divisions shall also comply with the requirements of paragraph 4.1.1.8.    

7.2.2 Ducts provided for ventilation to accommodation spaces, service spaces or control stations shall not pass through machinery spaces of category A, galleys, vehicle spaces, ro-ro spaces or special category spaces unless they comply with the conditions specified in paragraphs 7.2.2.1.1 to 7.2.2.1.3 or 7.2.2.2.1 and 7.2.2.2.2 below: 

.1.1 the ducts where they pass through a machinery space of category A, galley, vehicle space, ro-ro space or special category space are constructed of steel in accordance with paragraphs 7.2.1.1.1 and 7.2.1.1.2;  

.1.2 automatic fire dampers are fitted close to the boundaries penetrated; and  

.1.3 the integrity of the machinery space, galley, vehicle space, ro-ro space or special category space boundaries is maintained at the penetrations; or

.2.2 the ducts are insulated to “A-60” standard within the machinery space, galley, vehicle space, ro-ro space or special category space; except that penetrations of main zone divisions shall also comply with the requirements of paragraph 4.1.1.8.      

7.3 Details of duct penetrations 

7.3.1 Where a thin plated duct with a free cross-sectional area equal to, or less than, 0.02 m <sup>2</sup> passes through “A” class bulkheads or decks, the opening shall be lined with a steel sheet sleeve having a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 200 mm, divided preferably into 100 mm on each side of the bulkhead or, in the case of the deck, wholly laid on the lower side of the decks pierced. Where ventilation ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.02 m <sup>2</sup> pass through “A” class bulkheads or decks, the opening shall be lined with a steel sheet sleeve. However, where such ducts are of steel construction and pass through a deck or bulkhead, the ducts and sleeves shall comply with the following: 

.1 The sleeves shall have a thickness of at least 3 mm and a length of at least 900 mm. When passing through bulkheads, this length shall be divided preferably into 450 mm on each side of the bulkhead. These ducts, or sleeves lining such ducts, shall be provided with fire insulation. The insulation shall have at least the same fire integrity as the bulkhead or deck through which the duct passes; and  

.2 Ducts with a free cross-sectional area exceeding 0.075 m <sup>2</sup> shall be fitted with fire dampers in addition to the requirements of paragraph 7.3.1.1. The fire damper shall operate automatically, but shall also be capable of being closed manually from both sides of the bulkhead or deck. The damper shall be provided with an indicator which shows whether the damper is open or closed. Fire dampers are not required, however, where ducts pass through spaces surrounded by “A” class divisions, without serving those spaces, provided those ducts have the same fire integrity as the divisions which they pierce. Fire dampers shall be easily accessible. Where they are placed behind ceilings or linings, these ceilings or linings shall be provided with an inspection door on which a plate reporting the identification number of the fire damper is provided. The fire damper identification number shall also be placed on any remote controls required.

7.4 Ventilation systems for passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers 

7.4.1 The ventilation system of a passenger ship carrying more than 36 passengers shall be in compliance with the following additional requirements.  

7.4.2 In general, the ventilation fans shall be so disposed that the ducts reaching the various spaces remain within the main vertical zone.  

7.4.3 Where ventilation systems penetrate decks, precautions shall be taken, in addition to those relating to the fire integrity of the deck required by paragraphs 3.1 and 4.1.1.5, to reduce the likelihood of smoke and hot gases passing from one 'tween-deck space to another through the system. In addition to insulation requirements contained in paragraph 7.4, vertical ducts shall, if necessary, be insulated as required by the appropriate tables 9.1 and 9.2.  

7.4.4 Except in cargo spaces, ventilation ducts shall be constructed of the following materials: 

.1 ducts not less than 0.075 m <sup>2</sup> in free cross-sectional area and all vertical ducts serving more than a single 'tween-deck space shall be constructed of steel or other equivalent material;

2.1 Fire mains and hydrants 

2.1.1 General Materials readily rendered ineffective by heat shall not be used for fire mains and hydrants unless adequately protected. The pipes and hydrants shall be so placed that the fire hoses may be easily coupled to them. The arrangement of pipes and hydrants shall be such as to avoid the possibility of freezing. Suitable drainage provisions shall be provided for fire main piping. Isolation valves shall be installed for all open deck fire main branches used for purposes other than fire fighting. In ships where deck cargo may be carried, the positions of the hydrants shall be such that they are always readily accessible and the pipes shall be arranged as far as practicable to avoid risk of damage by such cargo.  

2.1.2 Ready availability of water supply The arrangements for the ready availability of water supply shall be: 

.1 in passenger ships: 

.1.1 of 1,000 gross tonnage and upwards such that at least one effective jet of water is immediately available from any hydrant in an interior location and so as to ensure the continuation of the output of water by the automatic starting of one required fire pump;  

.1.2 of less than 1,000 gross tonnage by automatic start of at least one fire pump or by remote starting from the navigation bridge of at least one fire pump. If the pump starts automatically or if the bottom valve cannot be opened from where the pump is remotely started, the bottom valve shall always be kept open; and  

.1.3 if fitted with periodically unattended machinery spaces in accordance with Regulation II-1/54, the Administration shall determine provisions for fixed water fire-extinguishing arrangement for such spaces equivalent to those required for normally attended machinery spaces;    

.2 in cargo ships: 

.2.1 to the satisfaction of the Administration; and  

.2.2 with a periodically unattended machinery space or when only one person is required on watch, there shall be immediate water delivery from the fire main system at a suitable pressure, either by remote starting of one of the main fire pumps with remote starting from the navigating bridge and fire control station, if any, or permanent pressurization of the fire main system by one of the main fire pumps, except that the Administration may waive this requirement for cargo ships of less than 1,600 gross tonnage if the fire pump starting arrangement in the machinery space is in an easily accessible position.      

2.1.3 Diameter of fire mains The diameter of the fire main and water service pipes shall be sufficient for the effective distribution of the maximum required discharge from two fire pumps operating simultaneously, except that in the case of cargo ships the diameter need only be sufficient for the discharge of 140 m <sup>3</sup> /h.

### Regulation  20  

####Protection of vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces

###1 Purpose

The purpose of this regulation is to provide additional safety measures in order to address the fire safety objectives of this chapter for ships fitted with vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces. For this purpose, the following functional requirements shall be met: 

.1 fire protection systems shall be provided to adequately protect the ship from the fire hazards associated with vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces;  

.2 ignition sources shall be separated from vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces; and  

.3 vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces shall be adequately ventilated.   
###2 General requirements

2.1 Application In addition to complying with the requirements of regulations in parts B, C, D and E, as appropriate, vehicle, special category and ro-ro spaces shall comply with the requirements of this regulation.  

2.2 Basic principles for passenger ships 

2.2.1 The basic principle underlying the provisions of this regulation is that the main vertical zoning required by regulation 9.2 may not be practicable in vehicle spaces of passenger ships and, therefore, equivalent protection must be obtained in such spaces on the basis of a horizontal zone concept and by the provision of an efficient fixed fire-extinguishing system. Based on this concept, a horizontal zone for the purpose of this regulation may include special category spaces on more than one deck provided that the total overall clear height for vehicles does not exceed 10 m.  

2.2.2 The basic principle underlying the provisions of paragraph 2.2.1 are also applicable to ro-ro spaces.  

2.2.3 The requirements of ventilation systems, openings in “A” class divisions and penetrations in “A” class divisions for maintaining the integrity of vertical zones in this chapter shall be applied equally to decks and bulkheads forming the boundaries separating horizontal zones from each other and from the remainder of the ship.     
###3 Precaution against ignition of flammable vapours in closed vehicle spaces, closed ro-ro spaces and special category spaces

3.1 Ventilation systems 

3.1.1 Capacity of ventilation systems There shall be provided an effective power ventilation system sufficient to give at least the following air changes: 

.1 Passenger ships  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Special category spaces  | 10 air changes per hour  |
| Closed ro-ro and vehicle spaces other than special category spaces for ships carrying more than 36 passengers  | 10 air changes per hour  |
| Closed ro-ro and vehicle spaces other than special category spaces for ships carrying not more than 36 passengers  | 6 air changes per hour  |

.2  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Cargo ships  | 6 air changes per hour  |

The Administration may require an increased number of air changes when vehicles are being loaded and unloaded.    

3.1.2 Performance of ventilation systems 

3.1.2.1 In passenger ships, the power ventilation system required in paragraph 3.1.1 shall be separate from other ventilation systems and shall be in operation at all times when vehicles are in such spaces. Ventilation ducts serving such cargo spaces capable of being effectively sealed shall be separated for each such space. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.  

3.1.2.2 In cargo ships, ventilation fans shall normally be run continuously whenever vehicles are on board. Where this is impracticable, they shall be operated for a limited period daily as weather permits and in any case for a reasonable period prior to discharge, after which period the ro-ro or vehicle space shall be proved gas-free. One or more portable combustible gas detecting instruments shall be carried for this purpose. The system shall be entirely separate from other ventilating systems. Ventilation ducts serving ro-ro or vehicle spaces shall be capable of being effectively sealed for each cargo space. The system shall be capable of being controlled from a position outside such spaces.  

3.1.2.3 The ventilation system shall be such as to prevent air stratification and the formation of air pockets.    

3.1.3 Indication of ventilation systems Means shall be provided on the navigation bridge to indicate any loss of the required ventilating capacity.  

3.1.4 Closing appliances and ducts 

3.1.4.1 Arrangements shall be provided to permit a rapid shutdown and effective closure of the ventilation system from outside of the space in case of fire, taking into account the weather and sea conditions.  

3.1.4.2 Ventilation ducts, including dampers, within a common horizontal zone shall be made of steel. In passenger ships, ventilation ducts that pass through other horizontal zones or machinery spaces shall be “A-60” class steel ducts constructed in accordance with Regulations 9.7.2.1.1 and 9.7.2.1.2.  

3.1.5 Permanent openings Permanent openings in the side plating, the ends or deckhead of the space shall be so situated that a fire in the cargo space does not endanger stowage areas and embarkation stations for survival craft and accommodation spaces, service spaces and control stations in superstructures and deckhouses above the cargo spaces.      

3.2 Electrical equipment and wiring 

3.2.1 Except as provided in paragraph 3.2.2, electrical equipment and wiring shall be of a type suitable for use in an explosive petrol and air mixture.  

3.2.2 In case of other than special category spaces below the bulkhead deck, notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 3.2.1, above a height of 450 mm from the deck and from each platform for vehicles, if fitted, except platforms with openings of sufficient size permitting penetration of petrol gases downwards, electrical equipment of a type so enclosed and protected as to prevent the escape of sparks shall be permitted as an alternative on condition that the ventilation system is so designed and operated as to provide continuous ventilation of the cargo spaces at the rate of at least ten air changes per hour whenever vehicles are on board.    

3.3 Electrical equipment and wiring in exhaust ventilation ducts Electrical equipment and wiring, if installed in an exhaust ventilation duct, shall be of a type approved for use in explosive petrol and air mixtures and the outlet from any exhaust duct shall be sited in a safe position, having regard to other possible sources of ignition.  

3.4 Other ignition sources Other equipment which may constitute a source of ignition of flammable vapours shall not be permitted.  

3.5 Scuppers and discharges Scuppers shall not be led to machinery or other spaces where sources of ignition may be present.   
###4 Detection and alarm

4.1 Fixed fire detection and fire alarm systems Except as provided in paragraph 4.3.1, there shall be provided a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system complying with the requirements of the Fire Safety Systems Code. The fixed fire detection system shall be capable of rapidly detecting the onset of fire. The type of detectors and their spacing and location shall be to the satisfaction of the Administration taking into account the effects of ventilation and other relevant factors. After being installed the system shall be tested under normal ventilation conditions and shall give an overall response time to the satisfaction of the Administration.  

4.2 Sample extraction smoke detection systems Except open ro-ro spaces, open vehicle spaces and special category spaces, a sample extraction smoke detection system complying with the requirements of the Fire Safety Systems Code may be used as an alternative of the fixed fire detection and fire alarm system required in paragraph 4.1.  

4.3 Special category spaces 

4.3.1 An efficient fire patrol system shall be maintained in special category spaces. If an efficient fire patrol system is maintained by a continuous fire watch at all times during the voyage, a fixed fire detection and fire alarm system is not required.  

4.3.2 Manually operated call points shall be spaced so that no part of the space is more than 20 m from a manually operated call point, and one shall be placed close to each exit from such spaces.     
###5 Structural protection

Notwithstanding the provisions of regulation 9.2.2, in passenger ships carrying more than 36 passengers, the boundary bulkheads and decks of special category spaces and ro-ro spaces shall be insulated to “A-60” class standard. However, where a category (5), (9) and (10) space, as defined in regulation 9.2.2.3, is on one side of the division the standard may be reduced to “A-0”. Where fuel oil tanks are below a special category space or a ro-ro space, the integrity of the deck between such spaces, may be reduced to “A-0” standard. 
###6 Fire-extinction

6.1 Fixed fire-extinguishing systems 

6.1.1 Vehicle spaces and ro-ro spaces which are not special category spaces and are capable of being sealed from a location outside of the cargo spaces shall be fitted with a fixed gas fire-extinguishing system which shall comply with the provisions of the Fire Safety Systems Code, except that: 

.1 if a carbon dioxide fire-extinguishing system is fitted, the quantity of gas available shall be at least sufficient to give a minimum volume of free gas equal to 45% of the gross volume of the largest such cargo space which is capable of being sealed, and the arrangements shall be such as to ensure that at least two thirds of the gas required for the relevant space shall be introduced within 10 min;  

.2 any other fixed inert gas fire-extinguishing system or fixed high-expansion foam fire-extinguishing system may be fitted provided the Administration is satisfied that an equivalent protection is achieved; and  

.3 as an alternative, a fire-extinguishing system meeting the requirements of paragraph 6.1.2 may be fitted.    

6.1.2 Ro-ro and vehicle spaces not capable of being sealed and special category spaces shall be fitted with an approved fixed pressure water spraying system for manual operation which shall protect all parts of any deck and vehicle platform in such spaces. Such water-spray systems shall have: 

.1 a pressure gauge on the valve manifold;  

.2 clear marking on each manifold valve indicating the spaces served;  

.3 instructions for maintenance and operation located in the valve room; and  

.4 a sufficient number of drainage valves.    

6.1.3 The Administration may permit the use of any other fixed fire-extinguishing system that has been shown that it is not less effective by a full-scale test in conditions simulating a flowing petrol fire in a vehicle space or a ro-ro space in controlling fires likely to occur in such a space.  

6.1.4 The requirement of this paragraph shall apply to ships constructed on or after 1 January 2010. Ships constructed on or after 1 July 2002 and before 1 January 2010 shall comply with the previously applicable requirements of paragraph 6.1.4, as amended by resolution MSC.99(73). When fixed pressure water-spraying systems are fitted, in view of the serious loss of stability which could arise due to large quantities of water accumulating on the deck or decks during the operation of the fixed pressure water-spraying system, the following arrangements shall be provided: 

.1 in passenger ships: 

.1.1 in the spaces above the bulkhead deck, scuppers shall be fitted so as to ensure that such water is rapidly discharged directly overboard, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization ; <sup> 5)  Refer to the Guidelines for drainage systems in closed vehicle and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces, to be developed by the Organization.  </sup>

.1.2.2 any operation of valves referred to in paragraph 6.1.4.1.2.1 shall be recorded in the log-book;    

.1.3 in the spaces below the bulkhead deck, the Administration may require pumping and drainage facilities to be provided additional to the requirements of regulation II-1/35-1. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water-spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization . The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment; <sup> 5)  Refer to the Guidelines for drainage systems in closed vehicle and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces, to be developed by the Organization.  </sup>    

.2 in cargo ships, the drainage and pumping arrangements shall be such as to prevent the build-up of free surfaces. In such case, the drainage system shall be sized to remove no less than 125% of the combined capacity of both the water-spraying system pumps and the required number of fire hose nozzles, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization . The drainage system valves shall be operable from outside the protected space at a position in the vicinity of the extinguishing system controls. Bilge wells shall be of sufficient holding capacity and shall be arranged at the side shell of the ship at a distance from each other of not more than 40 m in each watertight compartment. If this is not possible, the adverse effect upon stability of the added weight and free surface of water shall be taken into account to the extent deemed necessary by the Administration in its approval of the stability information . Such information shall be included in the stability information supplied to the master as required by regulation II-1/5-1. <sup> 5)  Refer to the Guidelines for drainage systems in closed vehicle and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces, to be developed by the Organization.  </sup> <sup> 6)  Refer to the Recommendation on fixed fire-extinguishing systems for special category spaces, adopted by the Organization by resolution A.123(V).  </sup>    

6.1.5 On all ships, for closed vehicles and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces, where fixed pressure water-spraying systems are fitted, means shall be provided to prevent the blockage of drainage arrangements, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization . Ships constructed before 1 January 2010 shall comply with the requirements of this paragraph by the first survey after 1 January 2010. <sup> 5)  Refer to the Guidelines for drainage systems in closed vehicle and ro-ro spaces and special category spaces, to be developed by the Organization.  </sup>

### Regulation  31  

####Danger messages

1.  The master of every ship which meets with dangerous ice, a dangerous derelict, or any other direct danger to navigation, or a tropical storm, or encounters sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures, or winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received, is bound to communicate the information by all means at his disposal to ships in the vicinity, and also to the competent authorities. The form in which the information is sent is not obligatory. It may be transmitted either in plain language (preferably English) or by means of the International Code of Signals.   
2.  Each Contracting Government will take all steps necessary to ensure that when intelligence of any of the dangers specified in paragraph 1 is received, it will be promptly brought to the knowledge of those concerned and communicated to other interested Governments.   
3.  The transmission of messages respecting the dangers specified is free of cost to the ships concerned.   
4.  All radio messages issued under paragraph 1 shall be preceded by the safety signal, using the procedure as prescribed by the Radio Regulations as defined in regulation IV/2.   

### Regulation  32  

####Information required in danger messages

The following information is required in danger messages: 

1 Ice, derelicts and other direct dangers to navigation: 

.1 The kind of ice, derelict or danger observed.  

.2 The position of the ice, derelict or danger when last observed.  

.3 The time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) when the danger was last observed.    

2 Tropical cyclones (storms) 

.1 A statement that a tropical cyclone has been encountered. This obligation should be interpreted in a broad spirit, and information transmitted whenever the master has good reason to believe that a tropical cyclone is developing or exists in the neighbourhood.  

.2 Time, date (Universal Co-ordinated Time) and position of ship when the observation was taken.  

.3 As much of the following information as is practicable should be included in the message: 

– barometric pressure, preferably corrected (stating millibars, millimetres, or inches, and whether corrected or uncorrected);  

– barometric tendency (the change in barometric pressure during the past three hours);  

– true wind direction;  

– wind force (Beaufort scale);  

– state of the sea (smooth, moderate, rough, high);  

– swell (slight, moderate, heavy) and the true direction from which it comes. Period or length of swell (short, average, long) would also be of value;  

– true course and speed of ship.       
###Subsequent observations

3 When a master has reported a tropical cyclone or other dangerous storm, it is desirable but not obligatory, that further observations be made and transmitted hourly, if practicable, but in any case at intervals of not more than 3 hours, so long as the ship remains under the influence of the storm.  

4 Winds of force 10 or above on the Beaufort scale for which no storm warning has been received. This is intended to deal with storms other than the tropical cyclones referred to in paragraph 2; when such a storm is encountered, the message should contain similar information to that listed under the paragraph but excluding the details concerning sea and swell.  

5 Sub-freezing air temperatures associated with gale force winds causing severe ice accretion on superstructures: 

.1 Time and date (Universal Co-ordinated Time).  

.2 Air temperature.  

.3 Sea temperature (if practicable).  

.4 Wind force and direction.

### Regulation  33  

####Distress situations: obligations and procedures

1.  The master of a ship at sea which is in a position to be able to provide assistance on receiving information from any source that persons are in distress at sea, is bound to proceed with all speed to their assistance, if possible informing them or the search and rescue service that the ship is doing so. This obligation to provide assistance applies regardless of the nationality or status of such persons or the circumstances in which they are found. If the ship receiving the distress alert is unable or, in the special circumstances of the case, considers it unreasonable or unnecessary to proceed to their assistance, the master must enter in the log-book the reason for failing to proceed to the assistance of the persons in distress, taking into account the recommendation of the Organization, to inform the appropriate search and rescue service accordingly.   
1-1.  Contracting Governments shall co-ordinate and co-operate to ensure that masters of ships providing assistance by embarking onboard persons in distress at sea are released from their obligations with minimum further deviation from the ships’ intended voyage, provided that releasing the master of the ship from the obligations under the current regulation does not further endanger the safety of life at sea. The Contracting Government responsible for the search and rescue region in which such assistance is rendered shall exercise primary responsibility for ensuring such co-ordination and co-operation occurs, so that survivors assisted are disembarked from the assisting ship and delivered to a place of safety, taking into account the particular circumstances of the case and guidelines developed by the Organization. In these cases the relevant Contracting Governments shall arrange for such disembarkation to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable.   
2.  The master of a ship in distress or the search and rescue service concerned, after consultation, so far as may be possible, with the masters of ships which answer the distress alert, has the right to requisition one or more of those ships as the master of the ship in distress or the search and rescue service considers best able to render assistance, and it shall be the duty of the master or masters of the ship or ships requisitioned to comply with the requisition by continuing to proceed with all speed to the assistance of persons in distress.   
3.  Masters of ships shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph 1 on learning that their ships have not been requisitioned and that one or more other ships have been requisitioned and are complying with the requisition. This decision shall, if possible be communicated to the other requisitioned ships and to the search and rescue service.   
4.  The master of a ship shall be released from the obligation imposed by paragraph 1 and, if his ship has been requisitioned, from the obligation imposed by paragraph 2 on being informed by the persons in distress or by the search and rescue service or by the master of another ship which has reached such persons that assistance is no longer necessary.   
5.  The provisions of this regulation do not prejudice the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Assistance and Salvage at Sea, signed at Brussels on 23 September 1910, particularly the obligation to render assistance imposed by article 11 of that Convention.   
6.  Masters of ships who have embarked persons in distress at sea shall treat them with humanity, within the capabilities and limitations of the ship.   

### Regulation  34  

####Safe navigation and avoidance of dangerous situations

1.  Prior to proceeding to sea, the master shall ensure that the intended voyage has been planned using the appropriate nautical charts and nautical publications for the area concerned, taking into account the guidelines and recommendations developed by the Organization.   
2.  The voyage plan shall identify a route which: 

.1 takes into account any relevant ships' routeing systems;  

.2 ensures sufficient sea room for the safe passage of the ship throughout the voyage;  

.3 anticipates all known navigational hazards and adverse weather conditions; and  

.4 takes into account the marine environmental protection measures that apply, and avoids as far as possible actions and activities which could cause damage to the environment.     

### Regulation  34-1  

####Master’s discretion

The owner, the charterer, the company operating the ship as defined in regulation IX/1, or any other person shall not prevent or restrict the master of the ship from taking or executing any decision which, in the master’s professional judgement, is necessary for safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment.  

### Regulation  35  

####Misuse of distress signals

The use of an international distress signal, except for the purpose of indicating that a person or persons are in distress, and the use of any signal which may be confused with an international distress signal, are prohibited.

When such cases are identified, the Administration shall ensure that such conflicts are resolved and that the possibility of recurrence is minimised.    

### Regulation  9  

####Control and compliance measures

###1 Control of ships in port

1.1 For the purpose of this chapter, every ship to which this chapter applies is subject to control when in a port of another Contracting Government by officers duly authorised by that Government, who may be the same as those carrying out the functions of regulation I/19. Such control shall be limited to verifying that there is onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate or a valid Interim International Ships Security Certificate issued under the provisions of part A of the ISPS Code (Certificate), which if valid shall be accepted, unless there are clear grounds for believing that the ship is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code.  

1.2 When there are such clear grounds, or where no valid Certificate is produced when required, the officers duly authorized by the Contracting Government shall impose any one or more control measures in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 1.3. Any such measures imposed must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.  

1.3 Such control measures are as follows: inspection of the ship, delaying the ship, detention of the ship, restriction of operations including movement within the port, or expulsion of the ship from port. Such control measures may additionally or alternatively include other lesser administrative or corrective measures.    

###2 Ships intending to enter a port of another Contracting Government

2.1 For the purpose of this chapter, a Contracting Government may require that ships intending to enter its ports provide the following information to officers duly authorized by that Government to ensure compliance with this chapter prior to entry into port with the aim of avoiding the need to impose control measures or steps: 

.1 that the ship possesses a valid Certificate and the name of its issuing authority;  

.2 the security level at which the ship is currently operating;  

.3 the security level at which the ship operated in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3;  

.4 any special or additional security measures that were taken by the ship in any previous port where it has conducted a ship/port interface within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3;  

.5 that the appropriate ship security procedures were maintained during any ship to ship activity within the timeframe specified in paragraph 2.3; or  

.6 other practical security-related information (but not details of the ship security plan), taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.   If requested by the Contracting Government, the ship or the Company shall provide confirmation, acceptable to that Contracting Government, of the information required above.  

2.2 Every ship to which this chapter applies intending to enter the port of another Contracting Government shall provide the information described in paragraph 2.1 on the request of the officers duly authorized by that Government. The master may decline to provide such information on the understanding that failure to do so may result in denial of entry into port.  

2.3 The ship shall keep records of the information referred to in paragraph 2.1 for the last 10 calls at port facilities.  

2.4 If, after receipt of the information described in paragraph 2.1, officers duly authorised by the Contracting Government of the port in which the ship intends to enter have clear grounds for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers shall attempt to establish communication with and between the ship and the Administration in order to rectify the non-compliance. If such communication does not result in rectification, or if such officers have clear grounds otherwise for believing that the ship is in non-compliance with the requirements of this chapter or part A of the ISPS Code, such officers may take steps in relation to that ship as provided in paragraph 2.5. Any such steps taken must be proportionate, taking into account the guidance given in part B of the ISPS Code.  

2.5 Such steps are as follows: 

.1 a requirement for the rectification of the non-compliance;  

.2 a requirement that the ship proceed to a location specified in the territorial sea or internal waters of that Contracting Government;  

.3 inspection of the ship, if the ship is in the territorial sea of the Contracting Government the port of which the ship intends to enter; or  

.4 denial of entry into port. Prior to initiating any such steps, the ship shall be informed by the Contracting Government of its intentions. Upon this information the master may withdraw the intention to enter that port. In such cases, this regulation shall not apply.      

###3 Additional provisions

3.1 In the event: 

.1 of the imposition of a control measure, other than a lesser administrative or corrective measure, referred to in paragraph 1.3; or  

.2 any of the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 are taken, an officer duly authorized by the Contracting Government shall forthwith inform in writing the Administration specifying which control measures have been imposed or steps taken and the reasons thereof. The Contracting Government imposing the control measures or steps shall also notify the recognized security organization, which issued the Certificate relating to the ship concerned and the Organization when any such control measures have been imposed or steps taken.    

3.2 When entry into port is denied or the ship is expelled from port, the authorities of the port State should communicate the appropriate facts to the authorities of the State of the next appropriate ports of call, when known, and any other appropriate coastal States, taking into account guidelines to be developed by the Organization. Confidentiality and security of such notification shall be ensured.  

3.3 Denial of entry into port, pursuant to paragraphs 2.4 and 2.5, or expulsion from port, pursuant to paragraphs 1.1 to 1.3, shall only be imposed where the officers duly authorized by the Contracting Government have clear grounds to believe that the ship poses an immediate threat to the security or safety of persons, or of ships or other property and there are no other appropriate means for removing that threat.  

3.4 The control measures referred to in paragraph 1.3 and the steps referred to in paragraph 2.5 shall only be imposed, pursuant to this regulation, until the non-compliance giving rise to the control measures or steps has been corrected to the satisfaction of the Contracting Government, taking into account actions proposed by the ship or the Administration, if any.  

3.5 When Contracting Governments exercise control under paragraph 1 or take steps under paragraph 2: 

.1 all possible efforts shall be made to avoid a ship being unduly detained or delayed. If a ship is thereby unduly detained, or delayed, it shall be entitled to compensation for any loss or damage suffered; and  

.2 necessary access to the ship shall not be prevented for emergency or humanitarian reasons and for security purposes.

####RECOMMENDATIONS APPLICABLE TO NUCLEAR SHIPS

NOTE: Throughout the following Recommendations, “the present Convention” means the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. Attention is drawn to the Regulations concerning nuclear ships in Chapter VIII of the present Convention.    

### 1  

####General Safety of Nuclear Ships

(a) Since a casualty involving the non-nuclear features of a nuclear ship, such as a steering gear failure, fire or collision, and so forth, could endanger the nuclear power plant, it is desirable that these features should provide for the maximum practicable safety. A nuclear ship should comply with the relevant requirements of the present Convention, the Administration and a recognized Classification Society. Components and systems such as watertight subdivision, fire protection, bilge pumping arrangements, fire-extinguishing arrangements, electrical installations, steering gear, astern power, stability and navigational aids should receive special consideration to ensure that adequate protection is given to the ship to minimize the hazards peculiar to the nuclear power plant. Consideration should be given to the results of past marine casualties involving similar size ships with the intent of preventing the dangerous uncontrolled release of radioactive or toxic materials in the event of similar casualties.  

(b) Special attention should be given to general structural strength of nuclear ships and to the local strength of structures in and around the reactor compartment.  

(c) A nuclear ship should remain afloat and have sufficient stability when not less than any two adjacent main watertight compartments are flooded, in all anticipated conditions of loading.  

(d) Fire protection systems and the watertight integrity should be at least equivalent to the highest standards of the present Convention.    

### 2  

####General Requirements of Nuclear Power Plant

(a) It should be demonstrated by calculation and experiment that the properties of the plant and the nature of the enclosure provide the maximum practicable protection against accidents or failures resulting in unreasonable radiation at sea or in port, to the crew, passengers or public, or to the waterways, or food or water resources.  

(b) The reactor installation should be designed to prevent an uncontrolled chain reaction under all foreseeable operational and accident conditions including sinking of the ship.  

(c) A nuclear ship equipped with a single-reactor nuclear power plant, the dependability of which has not been proven, should be provided with an emergency propulsion plant capable of propelling the ship at a navigable speed. Such emergency propulsion plant should be in a state of readiness whenever the ship is navigating in territorial waters.  

(d) The nuclear power plant should be such as to ensure manœuvrability equivalent to that of a similar conventional ship.  

(e) Requirements for standby emergency components for the conventional portions of the nuclear power plant should be in accordance with those for a similar conventional ship. Standby and emergency nuclear components should be considered and developed in relation to the type of nuclear power plant used.

(j) The machinery and reactor installation should be designed to operate satisfactorily under seagoing conditions having regard to the ship's attitude, accelerations and vibrations.  

(k) Reactor cooling systems should provide for the safe removal of decay heat from the reactor and should prevent excessive temperature conditions under all foreseeable operational and accident conditions at angles of heel and list within the stability range. Failure of decay heat removal facilities should not result in the release of hazardous amounts of radioactive or toxic materials from the enclosure of the reactor installation.  

(l) Adequate reactor controls, protective devices and instrumentation should be provided.  

(m) Necessary controls and instrumentation should be arranged to permit control of the reactor installation from outside its enclosure.    

### 3  

####Protection and Enclosure of Reactor Installation

(a) The reactor installation should be so arranged, protected and securely fastened as to minimize the probability of its damage in the event of a ship accident.  

(b) The reactor installation should be provided with enclosures, systems, or arrangements which in the event of damage to its components will prevent the release of hazardous amounts of radioactive or toxic materials into service and accommodation spaces and the ship's environment. These outer enclosures, systems, or arrangements should be subjected to suitable tests to demonstrate satisfactory performance under all foreseeable conditions of accident.  

(c) The enclosures, systems or arrangements should be located in such a manner as to minimize damage in the event of collision or grounding. In construction, arrangements should be made, if practicable, to facilitate the possible salvage of the reactor or of its essential parts from the vessel in the event of shipwreck, without adversely affecting the safety of the reactor installation under normal conditions.  

(d) Facilities should be provided to ensure that fires within and without the reactor installation do not impair the integrity of the enclosures, systems, or arrangements provided, or the arrangements provided for safely shutting down the reactor installation and retaining it in a safe condition.    

### 4  

####Shielding and Radiation Safety

(a) A nuclear power plant should be provided with reliable biological shielding to protect persons on board ship or within the immediate vicinity of the ship against hazardous effect of radiation under normal and accident conditions. Maximum permissible levels of radiation in accommodation and service spaces should be in accordance with international levels when established.  

(b) Maintenance and operation instructions in regard to appropriate radiation protection should be worked out for every nuclear ship. Knowledge of these instructions by the nuclear power plant personnel should be periodically checked by the Administration.  

(c) Radiation monitoring instruments should be installed at appropriate locations. These should give warning in the event of any radiation exceeding a predetermined safe level.    

### 5  

####Radioactive Wastes

(a) Special arrangements should be provided for the safe temporary storage, where necessary, and for the safe disposal of solid, liquid and gaseous radioactive wastes.  

(b) Monitoring devices should be provided for these waste disposal systems. These should give warning and, if necessary, take action in the event of any radiation exceeding a predetermined safe level.  

(c) The maximum permissible levels of radiation for waste disposal on the high seas should be in accordance with international levels when established.    

### 6  

####Fuelling and Maintenance

(a) Reactor fuelling should be carried out exclusively at locations suitably equipped for this purpose.  

(b) Arrangements should be provided to ensure that de-fuelling, re-fuelling, servicing and maintenance can be carried out without unacceptable exposure of personnel to radiation and without hazardous release of radioactive or toxic materials to the environment.    

### 7  

####Manning

The master, officers and members of the crew of a nuclear ship should possess qualifications and have undergone proper training appropriate to their responsibilities and duties in accordance with arrangements provided by the Administration. Such personnel should also be instructed as to the precautions to be taken in the matter of radiological protection.  

### 8  

####Operating Manual

The Operating Manual should provide detailed operating procedures for the various equipment and systems under normal and accident conditions, as well as provide for the maintenance of adequate records of operation, radiation levels, waste disposal, and tests and inspections pertinent to the safety of the reactor installation.  

### 9  

####Safety Assessment

(a) The Safety Assessment should include sufficiently detailed information to permit qualified personnel to assess the safety of the ship and its power plant, including standards and procedures followed, and to determine whether initial and continued performance will be safe. Typical items which the safety assessment should include are a description of the ship; propulsion and reactor systems; a discussion of the operation under normal sea, port and emergency conditions; a description of reactor control; protection and enclosure; radiation protection; radioactive waste disposal; fuelling; standby and emergency components; test procedures; manning and training requirements; and an evaluation of credible accidents which indicates that the hazards are minimized. The Safety Assessment should indicate that the reactor installation does not constitute an undue hazard, to the crew, passengers or the public, or to the waterways, or food or water resources.  

(b) The content of the Safety Assessment should not be considered limited to the information suggested herein, and such additional specific data as necessary should be made available. The complete Safety Assessment should be prepared for the first installation of a reactor type in a ship type. For second and following generation reactor and ship types where performance and safety have been demonstrated, acceptance may be based on an analysis of deviations from the previous design.    

### 10  

####Publication of Requirements

The Contracting Governments should publish any special requirements which they make regarding the approach, entry into, or stay in their ports of a nuclear ship.  

### 11  

####Special Control

After the safety of the nuclear ship and its nuclear power plant has been properly established, the following actions should, in general, be adequate to determine their safe operational conditions: 

(a) Examination of the daily log of the behaviour of the nuclear power plant and equipment, covering a reasonable period of between one week to one month including the stay in the last port.  

(b) Determination that the nuclear power plant is properly certified and that any periodic checks required by the Operating Manual have been complied with.

(a) The Safety Assessment should include sufficiently detailed information to permit qualified personnel to assess the safety of the ship and its power plant, including standards and procedures followed, and to determine whether initial and continued performance will be safe. Typical items which the safety assessment should include are a description of the ship; propulsion and reactor systems; a discussion of the operation under normal sea, port and emergency conditions; a description of reactor control; protection and enclosure; radiation protection; radioactive waste disposal; fuelling; standby and emergency components; test procedures; manning and training requirements; and an evaluation of credible accidents which indicates that the hazards are minimized. The Safety Assessment should indicate that the reactor installation does not constitute an undue hazard, to the crew, passengers or the public, or to the waterways, or food or water resources.  

(b) The content of the Safety Assessment should not be considered limited to the information suggested herein, and such additional specific data as necessary should be made available. The complete Safety Assessment should be prepared for the first installation of a reactor type in a ship type. For second and following generation reactor and ship types where performance and safety have been demonstrated, acceptance may be based on an analysis of deviations from the previous design.    

### 10  

####Publication of Requirements

The Contracting Governments should publish any special requirements which they make regarding the approach, entry into, or stay in their ports of a nuclear ship.  

### 11  

####Special Control

After the safety of the nuclear ship and its nuclear power plant has been properly established, the following actions should, in general, be adequate to determine their safe operational conditions: 

(a) Examination of the daily log of the behaviour of the nuclear power plant and equipment, covering a reasonable period of between one week to one month including the stay in the last port.  

(b) Determination that the nuclear power plant is properly certified and that any periodic checks required by the Operating Manual have been complied with.  

(c) Determination that radiation levels in areas within the ship and in the vicinity of the ship which are accessible to shore personnel are not in excess of maximum permissible levels specified by the Operating Manual to be determined by examination of the ship's records or by independent measurement.  

(d) Determination of the quantity and activity of radioactive waste stored aboard the ship by examination of the ship's records or by independent measurement, and of the procedures and programme for any disposal.  

(e) Determination that the reactor installation protection and enclosure is intact, and that any programme involving a breach of its integrity complies with the requirements of the Operating Manual.  

(f) Determination that conventional and emergency arrangements and equipment, the reliability of which is essential when navigating in narrow waters, are in efficient operating condition.    

####Internationaal Verdrag voor de Beveiliging van Mensenlevens op Zee, 1974

De Verdragsluitende Regeringen, Geleid door de wens de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee te bevorderen door in onderlinge overeenstemming hiertoe dienende eenvormige beginselen en voorschriften vast te stellen, Overwegend dat dit doel het best kan worden bereikt door het sluiten van een Verdrag ter vervanging van het Internationale Verdrag voor de Beveiliging van Mensenlevens op Zee, 1960, met inachtneming van de ontwikkelingen sedert dat Verdrag werd gesloten,   Zijn overeengekomen als volgt:

### DEEL  B  

####- ONDERZOEKEN EN CERTIFICATEN

### Voorschrift  6  

####Inspectie en Onderzoek

a. De inspectie en het onderzoek van schepen moeten, voor zover het de toepassing van de bepalingen van deze Voorschriften en het verlenen van vrijstellingen daarvan betreft, worden uitgevoerd door ambtenaren van de Administratie. De Administratie kan de inspecties en onderzoeken evenwel toevertrouwen hetzij aan experts die voor dat doel zijn benoemd, hetzij aan door haar erkende organisaties.  

b. Een Administratie die experts benoemt of organisaties erkent voor het verrichten van de inspecties en onderzoeken bedoeld in lid (a) moet een benoemde expert of erkende organisatie ten minste machtigen om: 

i. reparaties aan een schip te eisen;  

ii. inspecties en onderzoeken te verrichten indien daarom wordt verzocht door de bevoegde autoriteiten van een havenstaat.   De Administratie stelt de Organisatie in kennis van de specifieke verantwoordelijkheden en de voorwaarden van de aan de benoemde experts of erkende organisaties overgedragen bevoegdheid.  

c. Wanneer een benoemde expert of erkende organisatie vaststelt dat de toestand van het schip of van zijn uitrusting in belangrijke mate afwijkt van de gegevens van het certificaat of zodanig is dat het schip niet geschikt is zee te kiezen zonder gevaar voor het schip of voor de personen aan boord, moet deze expert of organisatie onmiddellijk er op letten dat corrigerende maatregelen worden genomen en stelt deze te zijner tijd de Administratie daarvan in kennis. Indien geen corrigerende maatregelen worden genomen, moet het desbetreffende certificaat worden ingetrokken en de Administratie onmiddellijk daarvan in kennis worden gesteld; en indien het schip zich in de haven van een andere Partij bevindt, moeten de bevoegde autoriteiten van de havenstaat eveneens onmiddellijk daarvan in kennis worden gesteld. Wanneer een ambtenaar van de Administratie, een benoemde expert of een erkende organisatie de bevoegde autoriteiten van de havenstaat in kennis heeft gesteld, verleent de Regering van de betrokken havenstaat deze ambtenaar, expert of organisatie alle nodige bijstand om hun verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit Voorschrift na te komen. Wanneer van toepassing zorgt de Regering van de betrokken havenstaat ervoor dat het schip niet vertrekt totdat het zee kan kiezen, of de haven kan verlaten ten einde zich te begeven naar de desbetreffende reparatiewerf, zonder gevaar voor het schip of de personen aan boord.  

d. In alle gevallen waarborgt de Administratie ten volle de volledigheid en doeltreffendheid van de inspectie en het onderzoek en verbindt zij zich ertoe de nodige regelingen te waarborgen om aan deze verplichting te voldoen.    

### Voorschrift  7  

####Onderzoeken van passagiersschepen

a. Een passagiersschip moet de hieronder volgende onderzoeken ondergaan:

d. Indien een hernieuwd onderzoek is voltooid en er geen nieuw certificaat kan worden afgegeven of aan het schip worden verstrekt voor de vervaldatum van het bestaande certificaat, kan de door de Administratie gemachtigde persoon of organisatie een aantekening op het bestaande certificaat plaatsen en wordt een dergelijk certificaat als geldig aanvaard voor een tijdvak van niet langer dan 5 maanden vanaf de datum van verstrijken.  

e. Indien een schip zich op het tijdstip waarop een certificaat zijn geldigheid verliest niet in een haven bevindt waar het moet worden onderzocht, kan de Administratie de geldigheidsduur van het certificaat verlengen, maar deze verlenging wordt uitsluitend verleend om het schip in staat te stellen zijn reis naar de haven waar het moet worden onderzocht te voltooien en dan uitsluitend in gevallen waarin het juist en redelijk voorkomt zulks te doen. Een certificaat mag niet worden verlengd voor een tijdvak van langer dan 3 maanden en een schip ten behoeve waarvan een verlenging is verleend, is bij zijn aankomst in de haven waar het moet worden onderzocht, niet gerechtigd uit hoofde van een zodanige verlenging die haven te verlaten zonder een nieuw certificaat. Wanneer het hernieuwd onderzoek is voltooid, is het nieuwe certificaat geldig tot: 

i. voor een passagiersschip een datum niet later dan 12 maanden na de vervaldatum van het bestaande certificaat voordat de verlenging werd verleend;

ii. voor een vrachtschip een datum niet later dan 5 jaar na de vervaldatum van het bestaande certificaat voordat de verlenging werd verleend.    

g. In bijzondere omstandigheden, zoals bepaald door de Administratie, behoeft een nieuw certificaat niet te worden gedateerd te rekenen van de vervaldatum van het bestaande certificaat zoals voorgeschreven onder (b)(ii) (e) of (f). In deze bijzondere omstandigheden is het nieuwe certificaat geldig tot: 

i. voor een passagiersschip een datum niet later dan 12 maanden na de datum van voltooing van het hernieuwd onderzoek;  

ii. voor een vrachtschip een datum niet later dan vijf jaar na de datum van voltooiing van het hernieuwd onderzoek,    

h. Indien een jaarlijks, tussentijds of periodiek onderzoek is voltooid vóór het einde van het in de desbetreffende voorschriften aangegeven tijdvak: 

i. wordt de verjaardatum op het desbetreffende certificaat door een aantekening op de rugzijde gewijzigd in een datum ten hoogste 3 maanden na de datum waarop het onderzoek werd voltooid;  

ii. worden de door de desbetreffende voorschriften vereiste volgende jaarlijkse, tussentijdse of periodieke onderzoeken voltooid met de in deze voorschriften voorgeschreven tussenpozen met inachtneming van de nieuwe verjaardatum;  

iii. kan de vervaldatum onveranderd blijven mits er een of meer jaarlijkse, tussentijdse of periodieke onderzoeken, al naar het geval, zijn verricht zodat de maximumtussenpozen tussen de in de desbetreffende voorschriften voorgeschreven onderzoeken niet worden overschreden.    

i. Een ingevolge Voorschrift 12 of 13 afgegeven certificaat verliest zijn geldigheid in de volgende gevallen: 

i. indien de desbetreffende onderzoeken en inspecties niet zijn voltooid binnen de ingevolge de Voorschriften 7(a), 8(a), 9(a) en 10(a) aangegeven tijdvakken;  

ii. indien geen aantekening op de rugzijde van het certificaat is geplaatst overeenkomstig deze voorschriften;  

iii. bij overdracht van het schip onder de vlag van een andere Staat. Er mag uitsluitend een nieuw certificaat worden afgegeven, wanneer de Regering die het nieuwe certificaat afgeeft er ten volle van overtuigd is dat het schip voldoet aan de eisen van Voorschrift 1 l(a) en (b). In het geval van een overdracht tussen Verdragsluitende Regeringen zendt de Regering van de Staat wiens vlag het schip voordien gerechtigd was te voeren, indien zij daarom wordt verzocht binnen drie maanden nadat de overdracht heeft plaats gevonden, zo spoedig mogelijk aan de Administratie afschriften van de certificaten die het schip aan boord had voor de overdracht en, indien beschikbaar, afschrif ten van de desbetreffende onderzoeksrapporten.      

### Voorschrift  15  

####Modellen van certificaten en van de uitrustingsrapporten

De ingevolge de Voorschriften 12 en 13 afgegeven certificaten moeten aan boord beschikbaar zijn zodat zij te allen tijde kunnen worden onderzocht.  

### Voorschrift  17  

####Erkenning van certificaten

Certificaten die onder gezag van een Verdragsluitende Regering zijn afgegeven, moeten door de andere Verdragsluitende Regeringen worden erkend voor alle doeleinden welke bij dit Verdrag zijn geregeld. De andere Verdragsluitende Regeringen moeten aan deze certificaten gelijke waarde toekennen als aan de certificaten die zij zelf hebben afgegeven.  

### Voorschrift  18  

####Aanhangsel bij certificaten

(a) Indien tijdens een bepaalde reis een schip minder personen aan boord heeft dan het totale aantal dat in het Veiligheidscertificaat voor Passagiersschepen wordt vermeld, zodat het in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van deze Voorschriften gerechtigd is om een kleiner aantal reddingboten en andere reddingmiddelen aan boord te hebben dan in het certificaat is vermeld, mag door de Regering, persoon of organisatie bedoeld in Voorschrift 12 of 13 van dit Hoofdstuk, een aanhangsel worden afgegeven.  

(b) Dit aanhangsel moet vermelden, dat onder de gegeven omstandigheden de bepalingen van deze Voorschriften niet worden overtreden. Het moet aan het certificaat worden gehecht en vervangt het daarin vermelde voor wat de reddingmiddelen betreft. Het aanhangsel is slechts geldig voor de bepaalde reis waarvoor het is afgegeven.    

### Voorschrift  19  

####Controle

a. Elk schip is, wanneer het zich in een haven van een andere Verdragsluitende Regering bevindt, onderworpen aan controle door bevoegde ambtenaren van die Regering, voor zover deze controle erop is gericht zekerheid te hebben dat de ingevolge Voorschrift 12 of Voorschrift 13 afgegeven certificaten geldig zijn.  

b. Indien zij geldig zijn, worden deze certificaten aanvaard, tenzij er gegronde redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat de toestand van het schip of van zijn uitrusting in belangrijke mate afwijkt van de gegevens van de certificaten of dat het schip en zijn uitrusting niet voldoen aan de bepalingen van Voorschrift 11(a) en (b).  

c. In de onder (b) genoemde omstandigheden of wanneer een certificaat is vervallen of opgehouden geldig te zijn, moet de controlerend ambtenaar stappen ondernemen ten einde te verzekeren dat het schip niet vertrekt totdat het zee kan kiezen of de haven kan verlaten ten einde zich te begeven naar de passende reparatiewerf, zonder gevaar voor het schip of de personen aan boord.  

d. In geval deze controle aanleiding geeft tot enigerlei interventie, stelt de controlerend ambtenaar de Consul of bij diens afwezigheid de dichtstbijzijnde diplomatieke vertegenwoordiger van de Staat wiens vlag het schip gerechtigd is te voeren terstond schriftelijk in kennis van alle omstandigheden waardoor de interventie noodzakelijk werd geacht. Daarnaast worden de voor de afgifte van de certificaten verantwoordelijke benoemde experts of erkende organisaties eveneens op de hoogte gesteld. De feiten betreffende de interventie worden gerapporteerd aan de Organisatie.  

e. De betrokken autoriteit van de havenstaat brengt, behalve aan de onder (d) genoemde partijen, alle ter zake dienende gegevens omtrent het schip ter kennis van de autoriteiten van de volgende aanloophaven, indien zij niet in staat is maatregelen te nemen als aangegeven onder (c) of (d) of indien het het schip is toegestaan naar de volgende aanloophaven te varen.  

f. Wanneer ingevolge dit Voorschrift controle wordt verricht, moet al het mogelijke in het werk worden gesteld om te vermijden dat een schip onnodig wordt vastgehouden of vertraagd. Indien een schip daardoor onnodig wordt vastgehouden of vertraagd is het gerechtigd tot schadevergoeding voor geleden verliezen of schade.    

### Voorschrift  20  

####Voorrechten

Op de voorrechten van dit Verdrag mag slechts aanspraak worden gemaakt ten behoeve van een schip dat de geëigende geldige certificaten aan boord heeft.  

### DEEL  C  

####- ONGEVALLEN

### Voorschrift  21  

####Ongevallen

(a) Elke Administratie neemt op zich een onderzoek in te stellen naar elk ongeval dat haar schepen waarop de bepalingen van dit Verdrag van toepassing zijn, mocht overkomen, wanneer zij van oordeel is, dat zulk een onderzoek kan bijdragen tot het doen overwegen, welke wijzigingen in deze Voorschriften wenselijk zouden kunnen zijn.  

(b) Elke Verdragsluitende Regering neemt op zich de Organisatie inlichtingen te verstrekken betreffende de resultaten van zulk een onderzoek. Rapporten of aanbevelingen van de Organisatie die gebaseerd zijn op dergelijke inlichtingen, mogen niet de identiteit of nationaliteit van de betrokken schepen onthullen of op enigerlei wijze een schip of een persoon verantwoordelijk stellen of de verantwoordelijkheid daarvan veronderstellen.

1.1.  Dit Hoofdstuk is, tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, van toepassing op schepen waarvan de kiel is gelegd of waarvan de bouw zich in een soortgelijk stadium bevindt op of na 1 januari 2009.   
1.2.  Voor de toepassing van dit Hoofdstuk wordt verstaan onder *een soortgelijk bouwstadium* het stadium waarin: 

.1 de bouw ten behoeve van een specifiek schip aanvangt; en  

.2 is aangevangen met de montage van dat schip, welke ten minste 50 ton of 1 procent van de geschatte massa van alle bouwmaterialen omvat, naar gelang welke van beide het minst is.     
1.3.  Voor de toepassing van dit Hoofdstuk: 

.1 wordt verstaan onder *schepen die worden gebouwd*, schepen waarvan de kiel is gelegd of waarvan de bouw zich in een soortgelijk stadium bevindt;  

.2 wordt verstaan onder *alle schepen*, schepen gebouwd voor, op of na 1 januari 2009;  

.3 wordt een vrachtschip – ongeacht wanneer dit is gebouwd – dat wordt verbouwd tot passagiersschip, beschouwd als een passagiersschip gebouwd op de datum waarop een dergelijke verbouwing wordt aangevangen;  

.4 wordt onder *veranderingen en wijzigingen van ingrijpende aard*, in het kader van de waterdichte indeling en stabiliteit van een vrachtschip verstaan, elke wijziging van de constructie die van invloed is op het indelingsniveau van dat schip. Wanneer een vrachtschip een dergelijke wijziging ondergaat, moet worden aangetoond dat de voor dat schip berekende *A/R* ratio na deze wijzigingen niet geringer is dan de voor dat schip berekende *A/R* ratio vóór de wijziging. In die gevallen waarin de *A/R* ratio van het schip vóór wijziging evenwel gelijk is aan of groter is dan één, behoeft het schip na de wijziging slechts een *A* -waarde te hebben die niet geringer is dan *R*, berekend voor het gewijzigde schip.     
2.  Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald, draagt de Administratie er zorg voor dat schepen gebouwd voor 1 januari 2009 voldoen aan de voorschriften die van toepassing zijn krachtens Hoofdstuk II-1 van het Internationaal Verdrag voor de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, 1974, zoals gewijzigd bij resoluties MSC.1(XLV), MSC.6(48), MSC.11(55), MSC.12(56), MSC.13(57), MSC.19(58), MSC.26(60), MSC.27(61), resolutie 1 van de SOLAS-Conferentie van 1995, MSC.47(66), MSC.57(67), MSC.65(68), MSC.69(69), MSC.99(73), MSC.134(76), MSC.151(78) en MSC.170(79).   
3.  Alle schepen die reparaties, wijzigingen, veranderingen, alsmede de daarmee verband houdende aanpassing van de uitrusting ondergaan, moeten ten minste blijven voldoen aan de voorschriften die voordien op die schepen van toepassing waren. Schepen gebouwd vóór de datum waarop de desbetreffende wijzigingen in werking treden, moeten over het algemeen voldoen aan de voorschriften voor schepen gebouwd op of na die datum in ten minste dezelfde mate als voordat zij zodanige reparaties, wijzigingen, veranderingen, alsmede aanpassing van de uitrusting ondergingen. Reparaties, veranderingen en wijzigingen van ingrijpende aard, alsmede de daarmede verband houdende aanpassing van de uitrusting, moeten voldoen aan de voorschriften voor schepen gebouwd op of na de datum waarop de relevante wijzigingen in werking treden, voor zover de Administratie zulks redelijk en uitvoerbaar acht.   
4.  De Administratie van een Staat kan, wanneer zij van oordeel is dat de beschutte aard en de omstandigheden van de reis zodanig zijn dat de toepassing van bepaalde vereisten van dit Hoofdstuk redelijk noch noodzakelijk is, bepaalde schepen of klassen van schepen die bevoegd zijn de vlag van die Staat te voeren, die in de loop van hun reis niet meer dan 20 zeemijl uit de kust van het dichtstbijzijnde land varen van die vereisten vrijstellen.   
5.  Wanneer passagiersschepen worden gebruikt op bijzondere reizen voor het vervoer van grote aantallen passagiers op deze reizen, zoals bij het pelgrimvervoer, kan de Administratie van de Staat wiens vlag zulke schepen gerechtigd zijn te voeren, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het praktisch onuitvoerbaar is naleving van de vereisten van dit Hoofdstuk op te leggen, dergelijke schepen, vrijstellen van die vereisten, mits zij volledig voldoen aan de bepalingen van: 

.1 de voorschriften gehecht aan de Overeenkomst betreffende passagiersschepen gebezigd op bijzondere reizen, 1971; en  

.2 de voorschriften gehecht aan het Protocol betreffende de vereisten ten aanzien van passagiersruimten op passagiersschepen gebruikt op bijzondere reizen, 1973.

####Algemeen

1.  De eisen betreffende de lekstabiliteit in de delen B-1 tot en met B-4 zijn van toepassing op vrachtschepen met een lengte (*L*) van 80 m of meer en op alle passagiersschepen ongeacht hun lengte, maar niet op vrachtschepen waarvan is aangetoond dat zij voldoen aan voorschriften betreffende waterdichte indeling en stabiliteit in andere instrumenten ontwikkeld door de Organisatie. <sup> 1)  Vrachtschepen waarvan is aangetoond dat zij aan de volgende voorschriften voldoen, mogen van de toepassing van deel B-1 worden uitgesloten:    .1  Bijlage I bij MARPOL 73/78, met dien verstande dat OBO-schepen met type B vrijboorden niet zijn uitgesloten;    .2  Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk;    .3  Internationale Code voor gastankschepen;    .4  Richtsnoeren voor het ontwerp en de bouw van offshore bevoorradingsschepen (resolutie A.469(XII));    .5  Veiligheidscode voor schepen voor bijzondere doeleinden (resolutie A.534(13), als gewijzigd);    .6  Eisen betreffende de lekstabiliteit van voorschrift 27 van het Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen, 1966, als toegepast overeenkomstig resoluties A.320(IX) en A.514(13), met dien verstande dat in het geval van vrachtschepen waarop voorschrift 27(9) van toepassing is, waterdichte hoofddwarsschotten, willen deze als doeltreffend worden beschouwd, tussenruimten moeten hebben overeenkomstig paragraaf (12)(f) van resolutie A.320(IX), behoudens bij schepen bestemd voor het vervoer van deklading; en    .7  Eisen betreffende de lekstabiliteit van voorschrift 27 van het Protocol van 1988 betreffende de uitwatering van schepen, behoudens bij schepen bestemd voor het vervoer van deklading.    </sup>   
2.  De Administratie kan, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat ten minste dezelfde mate van veiligheid als met de toepassing van deze voorschriften wordt bereikt, voor een bepaald schip of een bepaalde groep schepen alternatieve methoden toestaan. Elke Administratie die dergelijke alternatieve methoden toestaat, doet de Organisatie de bijzonderheden daarvan toekomen.   
3.  Schepen moeten zo doeltreffend mogelijk worden ingedeeld, gelet op de aard van de dienst waarvoor ze zijn bestemd.De mate van waterdichte indeling varieert met de indelingslengte (*L <sub>s</sub>*) van het schip en de soort dienst, zodanig dat de grootste mate van waterdichte indeling overeenkomt met de grootste indelingslengte (*L <sub>s</sub>*) van het schip, dat hoofdzakelijk wordt ingezet voor het vervoer van personen.   
4.  Wanneer wordt voorgesteld dekken, inwendige huiden of langsschotten van voldoende stijfheid aan te brengen om de waterstroom duidelijk te beperken, dient ten genoegen van de Administratie te worden aangetoond dat voldoende aandacht wordt geschonken aan de gunstige of nadelige gevolgen daarvan voor de berekeningen.   

### DEEL  B-1  

####STABILITEIT

### Voorschrift  5  

####Stabiliteit in onbeschadigde toestand

<sup> 2)  Zie de Code betreffende de stabiliteit in onbeschadigde toestand voor alle typen schepen waarop IMO-instrumenten van toepassing zijn, aangenomen door de Organisatie bij resolutie A.749(18).  </sup>   
1.  Elk passagiersschip ongeacht de omvang ervan en elk vrachtschip met een lengte (*L*) van 24 m of meer, moet na voltooiing een hellingproef ondergaan en de stabiliteitskenmerken ervan moeten worden bepaald. In aanvulling op eventuele andere van toepassing zijnde vereisten van de bestaande voorschriften dienen schepen met een lengte van 24 m en meer en gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2010 ten minste te voldoen aan de vereisten van deel A van de IS-Code 2008.   
2.  De Administratie kan ontheffing van de hellingproef toestaan voor een individueel vrachtschip, mits fundamentele stabiliteitsgegevens beschikbaar zijn van de hellingproef van een zusterschip en ten genoegen van de Administratie wordt aangetoond dat aan deze fundamentele gegevens betrouwbare informatie omtrent de stabiliteit van het vrijgestelde schip kan worden ontleend, als vereist door voorschrift 5-1. Bij de voltooiing wordt een onderzoek naar het gewicht uitgevoerd wanneer, in vergelijking met de van het zusterschip afgeleide gegevens, een afwijking van de waterverplaatsing bij leeg schip wordt aangetroffen van meer dan 1% voor schepen met een lengte van 160 m of meer en 2% voor schepen met een lengte van 50 m of minder en als vastgesteld via lineaire interpolatie voor de tussenliggende lengtes of een afwijking van het zwaartepunt over de lengte bij leegschip van meer dan 0,5% van *L <sub>s</sub>*.   
3.  De Administratie kan ook ontheffing van de hellingproef toestaan voor een individueel schip of klasse schepen die speciaal zijn ontworpen voor het vervoer van vloeistoffen of erts in bulk wanneer uit verwijzing naar bestaande gegevens voor soortgelijke schepen duidelijk blijkt dat als gevolg van de omvang en voorzieningen van het schip onder alle waarschijnlijke ladingcondities meer dan voldoende metracentrische hoogte beschikbaar zal zijn.   
4.  Wanneer aan een schip wijzigingen worden aangebracht waardoor de aan de kapitein verstrekte stabiliteitsgegevens wezenlijk worden beïnvloed, moeten aangepaste stabiliteitsgegevens worden verstrekt. Indien nodig moet het schip een nieuwe hellingproef ondergaan. Het schip moet een nieuwe hellingproef ondergaan indien de verwachte afwijkingen een van de in paragraaf 5 vermelde waarden overschrijden.   
5.  Met periodieke tussenpozen van ten hoogste vijf jaar moeten alle passagiersschepen een onderzoek bij leeg schip ondergaan ter verificatie van mogelijke afwijkingen ten opzichte van de waterverplaatsing bij leeg schip en het zwaartepunt over de lengte van het schip. Het schip moet opnieuw een hellingproef ondergaan telkens wanneer, ten opzichte van de goedgekeurde stabiliteitsgegevens, een afwijking van de waterverplaatsing bij leeg schip van meer dan 2% of een afwijking van het zwaartepunt over de lengte van het schip van meer dan 1% van *L <sub>s</sub>* wordt aangetroffen of verwacht.   
6.  Elk schip moet op de voor- en achtersteven duidelijke diepgangsmarkeringen hebben. In het geval de diepgangmarkeringen zich niet op een gemakkelijk leesbare plaats bevinden of de diepgangmarkeringen vanwege de voor een bepaald type vaart met de bedrijfsvoering verband houdende beperkingen moeilijk leesbaar zijn, moet het schip eveneens zijn uitgerust met een betrouwbaar markeringssysteem voor de diepgang waarmee de diepgang van voor- en achtersteven kunnen worden bepaald.   

### Voorschrift  5-1  

####Aan de kapitein te verstrekken stabiliteitsgegevens

1.  Aan de kapitein moeten voor de Administratie aanvaardbare gegevens worden verstrekt noodzakelijk om hem in staat te stellen met snelle en eenvoudige handelingen accurate aanwijzingen te verkrijgen ten aanzien van de stabiliteit van het schip onder uiteenlopende dienstomstandigheden. Een afschrift van de stabiliteitsgegevens moet aan de Administratie worden verstrekt.   
2.  De gegevens moeten het volgende omvatten: 

.1 krommen of tabellen met de minimum operationele metracentrische hoogte (*GM*) ten opzichte van de diepgang waarmee de naleving van de desbetreffende vereisten ten aanzien van stabiliteit in beschadigde en onbeschadigde toestand wordt gewaarborgd, alternatieve overeenkomende krommen of tabellen van het maximum toelaatbare verticale zwaartepunt (*KG*) ten opzichte van de diepgang, of met de equivalenten van een van deze krommen;  

.2 instructies betreffende de werking van overvloei-inrichtingen; en  

.3 alle overige gegevens en hulpmiddelen die nodig zouden kunnen zijn om de vereiste stabiliteit in onbeschadigde en na beschadigde toestand te handhaven.     
3.  De stabiliteitsgegevens moeten de invloed weergeven van verschillende kop- of stuurlastsituaties in gevallen waar de operationele kop- of stuurlast +/- 0,5% van *L <sub>s</sub>* overschrijdt.   
4.  Voor schepen die moeten voldoen aan de stabiliteitsvereisten van deel B-1, moeten de in paragraaf 2 bedoelde gegevens worden bepaald aan de hand van de indelingsindex, en wel op de volgende wijze: Minimum vereiste *GM* (of maximum toelaatbare verticale positie van het zwaartepunt *KG*) voor de drie diepgangen *d**<sub>s</sub>*, *d**<sub>p</sub>* en *d**<sub>l</sub>* zijn gelijk aan de *GM* - (of *KG* -waarden) van de overeenkomstige beladingsscenario’s die worden gebruikt voor de berekening van de overlevingsfactor *s**i*. Voor de tussenliggende diepgangen moeten de te hanteren waarden worden verkregen door middel van lineaire interpolatie toegepast op de *GM* -waarde, uitsluitend tussen respectievelijk de diepste indelingsdiepgang en de partiële indelingsdiepgang, en tussen de partiële lastlijn en de diepgang bij lichte vaart. Met de stabiliteitscriteria in onbeschadigde toestand moet eveneens rekening worden gehouden door voor elke diepgang de maximum waarden van de vereiste minimum *GM* -waarden of het minimum van de maximaal toelaatbare *KG* -waarden voor beide criteria aan te houden. Indien de indelingsindex wordt berekend voor uiteenlopende kop- en stuurlastsituaties, moeten op dezelfde wijze verschillende vereiste *GM* -krommen worden gemaakt.   
5.  Wanneer krommen of tabellen voor de operationele minimum metracentrische hoogte (*GM*) ten opzichte van de diepgang niet adequaat zijn, moet de kapitein waarborgen dat de bedrijfsomstandigheid niet afwijkt van een bestudeerde beladingstoestand, of door middel van berekeningen verifiëren dat aan de stabiliteitscriteria voor deze beladingstoestand wordt voldaan.

De indeling van een schip wordt als voldoende beschouwd indien de bereikte indelingsindex *A*, vastgesteld in overeenstemming met voorschrift 7, niet geringer is dan de vereiste indelingsindex *R,* berekend in overeenstemming met dit voorschrift en indien bovendien de partiële indexen *A <sub>s</sub>*, *A <sub>p</sub>* en *A <sub>1</sub>* voor passagiersschepen niet kleiner zijn dan 0,9 *R* en voor vrachtschepen niet geringer dan 0,5 *R*.   
2.  Voor alle schepen waarop de lekstabiliteitsvereisten van dit Hoofdstuk van toepassing zijn, moet de te realiseren indelingsgraad door middel van de vereiste indelingsindex *R* als volgt worden bepaald: 

.1 In het geval van vrachtschepen met een lengte *(L <sub>s</sub>)* van meer dan 100 m:   ![10000053585](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053585)

.2 In het geval van vrachtschepen met een lengte *(L <sub>s</sub>)* van ten minste 80 m en ten hoogste 100 m:   ![10000053586](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053586)
waarbij *R <sub>o</sub>* de waarde *R* is als berekend overeenkomstig de formule uit subparagraaf .1  

.3 In het geval van passagiersschepen:   ![10000053587](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053587)
waarbij:   ![10000053588](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053588)
N <sub>1</sub> = aantal personen waarvoor reddingsboten beschikbaar zijn N <sub>2</sub> = aantal personen (met inbegrip van officiers en bemanningsleden) dat het schip meer dan N1 mag vervoeren.  

.4 Wanneer de bedrijfsomstandigheden zodanig zijn dat naleving van paragraaf 2.3 van dit voorschrift op basis van *N* = *N*<sub>1</sub> + 2 *N*<sub>2</sub> praktisch onuitvoerbaar is, en wanneer de Administratie van oordeel is dat er een gepaste geringere mate van gevaar bestaat, mag een lagere waarde voor *N* worden genomen, doch in geen geval minder dan *N* = *N*<sub>1</sub> + *N*<sub>2</sub>.

De bereikte indelingsindex *A* wordt verkregen door optelling van de partiële indexen *A*<sub>s</sub>, *A*<sub>p</sub> en *A*<sub>l</sub>, (gewogen als getoond) berekend voor de in voorschrift 2 omschreven diepgangen *d*<sub>s</sub>, *d*<sub>p</sub> en *d*<sub>l</sub> volgens de volgende formule:   ![10000053589](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053589)
Elke partiële index is een optelling van de bijdragen van alle bestudeerde schadescenario’s, met gebruikmaking van de volgende formule:   ![10000053590](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053590)
waarbij:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
|  *i*   | staat voor elke afdeling of groep van afdelingen in kwestie,  |
|  *p <sub>i</sub>*   | staat voor de mogelijkheid dat uitsluitend de afdeling of groep van afdelingen in kwestie kan vollopen, ongeacht de horizontale indeling, als omschreven in voorschrift 7-1,  |
|  *s <sub>i</sub>*   | staat voor de overlevingskans na vollopen van de afdeling of groep van afdelingen in kwestie, en omvat het effect van de horizontale indeling, als omschreven in voorschrift 7-2.  |

2.  Bij de berekening van *A* moet de niveautrim worden gebruikt voor de diepste indelingsdiepgang en de partiële indelingsdiepgang. De feitelijke bedrijfstrim moet worden gebruikt voor de diepgang bij lichte vaart. Indien de trimvariatie onder enige bedrijfsomstandigheid, vergeleken met de berekende trim, groter is dan 0,5% van *L <sub>s</sub>*, moeten een of meerdere aanvullende berekeningen van *A* voor dezelfde diepgangen maar met verschillende trimwaarden worden ingediend zodat, voor alle bedrijfsomstandigheden, het verschil in trim vergeleken met de voor één berekening gehanteerde referentietrim minder bedraagt dan 0,5% van *L <sub>s</sub>*.   
3.  Bij de vaststelling van de positieve stabiliteit (*GZ*) van de reststabiliteitskromme, moet worden uitgegaan van de waterverplaatsing in onbeschadigde toestand. Dat houdt in dat de rekenmethode van constante waterverplaatsing moet worden gehanteerd.   
4.  De in de bovenstaande formule vermelde optelling moet worden genomen over de indelingslengte (*L <sub>s</sub>*) van het schip, bij alle volloopscenario’s waarbij een enkele afdeling of twee of meer aangrenzende afdelingen betrokken zijn. In het geval van onsymmetrische voorzieningen moet de berekende *A* -waarde de gemiddelde waarde zijn die wordt verkregen uit de berekeningen van beide zijden. Als alternatief moet de *A* -waarde worden genomen als de waarde overeenkomend met de zijde die duidelijk het minst gunstige resultaat geeft.   
5.  Wanneer zijafdelingen zijn aangebracht, moeten voor alle volloopscenario’s waarbij zijafdelingen betrokken zijn de door de formule aangeduide optelling worden gehanteerd. Aanvullend mogen scenario’s van gelijktijdig vollopen van een zijafdeling of groep van zijafdelingen en de belendende afdeling of groep van afdelingen binnenboord worden toegevoegd, doch met uitzondering van dwarsbeschadiging die zich uitstrekt over meer dan de halve scheepsbreedte *B*. Voor de toepassing van dit voorschrift wordt dwarsscheeps gemeten vanaf de zijkant schip naar binnen toe, met een rechte hoek tot aan hart schip op het niveau van de diepste indelingsdiepgang.   
6.  Bij de in overeenstemming met de voorschriften gemaakte berekeningen voor het vollopen, behoeven slechts één breuk van de romp en één vrij oppervlak te worden aangenomen. De aangenomen verticale omvang van de beschadiging moet lopen van de basislijn naar boven naar een waterdichte horizontale indeling boven de waterlijn of hoger. Indien beschadiging van geringere omvang echter leidt tot een slechter resultaat, wordt deze geringere omvang aangenomen.   
7.  Indien pijpleidingen, kokers of tunnels gelegen zijn binnen de aangenomen omvang van de beschadiging moeten voorzieningen worden getroffen zodat het geleidelijk vollopen zich daardoor niet kan uitstrekken tot andere afdelingen dan die waarvan wordt aangenomen dat zij zijn volgelopen. De Administratie kan evenwel een geringe mate van geleidelijk vollopen toestaan indien wordt aangetoond dat de effecten ervan gemakkelijk kunnen worden beheerst en de veiligheid van het schip niet in gevaar komt.   

### Voorschrift  7-1  

####Berekening van de factor p <sub>i</sub>

1.  De factor *p <sub>i</sub>* voor een afdeling of groep van afdelingen wordt berekend in overeenstemming met de paragrafen 1.1 en 1.2, met gebruikmaking van de volgende notaties:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
|  *j*   | =  | het nummer van de achterste beschadigingzone waar beschadiging is ontstaan, te beginnen bij nr. 1 bij de achtersteven;  |
|  *n*   | =  | het aantal bij de beschadiging betrokken aangrenzende beschadigingszones;  |
|  *k*   | =  | het aantal specifieke lengteschotten die in een beschadigingzone als barrière voor dwarspenetratie dienen, gerekend van de huid naar hart schip toe. De huid heeft een waarde van *k* = 0;  |
|  *x1*   | =  | de afstand van het achterste einde van *L <sub>s</sub>* tot het achterste einde van de betrokken zone;  |
|  *x2*   | =  | de afstand van het achterste einde van *L <sub>s</sub>* tot het voorste einde van de betrokken zone;  |
|  *b*   | =  | de gemiddelde dwarsafstand in meters, gemeten op rechte hoeken met hart schip op de diepste indelingsdiepgang tussen de huid en een aangenomen verticaal vlak dat zich uitstrekt tussen de lengtebegrenzingen die worden gebruikt voor de berekening van de factor *p <sub>i</sub>* en die een raaklijn vormt, of gemeenschappelijk heeft, met het buitenste gedeelte van het desbetreffende langsschot of een deel hiervan. Dit verticale vlak moet zodanig zijn geplaatst dat de gemiddelde dwarsafstand naar de huid maximaal is, doch hoogstens tweemaal de geringste afstand tussen het vlak en de huid. Indien het bovenste deel van een lengteschot zich bevindt onder de diepste indelingsdiepgang, wordt het verticale vlak dat voor de bepaling van *b* wordt gebruikt, geacht zich naar boven uit te strekken tot de diepste indelingswaterlijn. In elk geval mag *b* niet groter zijn dan *B/2*.  |

Indien de beschadiging zich beperkt tot een enkele zone:   ![10000053591](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053591)

Indien de beschadiging drie of meer aangrenzende zones betreft:   ![10000053593](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053593)
en waarbij *r* (*x1*, *x2*, *b <sub>0</sub>*) = 0 

1.1 De factor *p* (*x1*, *x2*) moet worden berekend aan de hand van de volgende formules:  

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Totaal genormaliseerde maximum lengte van de beschadiging:  |  *J* <sub>max</sub>   | =  | 10/33  |
| Scharnierpunt in de verdeling:  |  *J <sub>kn</sub>*   | =  | 5/33  |
| Cumulatieve probabiliteit bij *J <sub>kn</sub>*:  |  *p <sub>k</sub>*   | =  | 11/12  |
| Maximum absolute lengte van de beschadiging:  |  *l* <sub>max</sub>   | =  | 60 m  |
| Lengte waarbij de genormaliseerde verdeling eindigt:  |  *L* <sup>*</sup>   | =  | 260 m  |

Kansdichtheid bij *J* = 0:   ![10000053594](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053594)

De niet-dimensionale lengte van de beschadiging:   ![10000053598](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053598)
De genormaliseerde lengte van een afdeling of groep van afdelingen: *J <sub>n</sub>* moet de geringste van *J* en *J <sub>m</sub>* zijn 

1.1.1 Wanneer geen van de begrenzingen van de desbetreffende afdeling of groep van afdelingen met het achterste of voorste einde samenvallen:   ![10000053599](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053599)

1.1.2 Wanneer de achterste begrenzing van de desbetreffende afdeling of groep van afdelingen met het achterste einde samenvalt of de voorste begrenzing van de desbetreffende afdeling of groep van afdelingen met het voorste einde samenvalt:   ![10000053600](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053600)

1.1.3 Wanneer de desbetreffende afdeling of groep van afdelingen zich uitstrekt over de gehele indelingslengte (*L <sub>s</sub>*):   ![10000053601](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053601)

1.2 De factor *r(x1, x2, b)* wordt bepaald aan de hand van de volgende formules:   ![10000053602](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053602)
waarbij:   ![10000053603](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053603)

### Voorschrift  7-2  

####Berekening van de factor s <sub>i</sub>

1.  De factor *s <sub>i</sub>* wordt bepaald voor elk verondersteld volloopscenario, waarbij een afdeling of groep van afdelingen betrokken is, in overeenstemming met de volgende notaties en met de bepalingen van dit voorschrift: *θ <sub>e</sub>* is de slagzijhoek in de eindtoestand bij elk stadium van vollopen, in graden; *θ <sub>v</sub>* is de hoek, bij elk stadium van vollopen, waarbij de stabiliteit negatief wordt, of de hoek waarbij een opening die niet waterdicht kan worden afgesloten, ondergedompeld raakt; *GZ*<sub>max</sub> is de maximale positieve stabiliteit, in meters, tot aan de hoek θ *<sub>v</sub>*; *Bereik* is het bereik van de positieve stabiliteit, in graden, gemeten vanaf de hoek θ *<sub>e</sub>*. Het positieve bereik moet lopen tot aan de hoek θ *<sub>v</sub>*; *Stadium van vollopen* is een onderscheiden fase bij het vollopen, met inbegrip van het stadium vóór overvloeien (indien van toepassing) totdat de uiteindelijke evenwichtspositie is bereikt. 

1.1 De factor *s <sub>i</sub>*, wordt voor elk beschadigingsscenario bij elke initiële beladingstoestand, *d <sub>i</sub>*, verkregen via de formule:   ![10000053607](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053607)
waarbij: *s*<sub>tussenliggend,i</sub> de overlevingskans is bij alle tussenliggende stadia van vollopen tot aan de uiteindelijke evenwichtstoestand; deze wordt berekend in overeenstemming met paragraaf 2; *s*<sub>eind,i</sub> de overlevingskans is in de uiteindelijke evenwichtstoestand bij vollopen. Deze wordt berekend in overeenstemming met paragraaf 3; *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> de overlevingskans is bij hellende momenten; deze wordt berekend in overeenstemming met paragraaf 4.     
2.  De factor *s*<sub>tussenliggend,i</sub> is uitsluitend van toepassing op passagiersschepen (bij vrachtschepen moet *s*<sub>tussenliggend,i</sub> als eenheid worden genomen); namelijk de geringste van de s-factoren die worden verkregen bij alle stadia van vollopen, met inbegrip van het stadium vóór overvloeien, indien van toepassing; dit moet als volgt worden berekend:   ![10000053608](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053608)
waarbij *GZ*<sub>max</sub> niet meer mag bedragen dan 0,05 m en *Bereik* niet meer dan 7°. *s*<sub>tussenliggend</sub> = 0, indien de tussenliggende hellingshoek meer dan 15º bedraagt. Indien overvloei-inrichtingen nodig zijn, mag het overvloeien niet langer duren dan 10 minuten.   
3.  De factor *s*<sub>eind,i</sub> wordt verkregen door middel van de volgende formule:   ![10000053609](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053609)
waarbij:   ![10000053610](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053610)
waarbij: *θ*<sub>min</sub> is 7° voor passagiersschepen en 25° voor vrachtschepen; en *θ*<sub>max</sub> is 15° voor passagiersschepen en 30° voor vrachtschepen.   
4.  De factor *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> is uitsluitend van toepassing op passagiersschepen (voor vrachtschepen moet *s*<sub>mom,i</sub> als eenheid worden genomen) en moet worden berekend bij de uiteindelijke evenwichtspositie, met de volgende formule:   ![10000053611](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053611)
waarbij: *Verplaatsing* de waterverplaatsing is bij de indelingsdiepgang; *M*<sub>helling</sub> het maximum veronderstelde hellend moment is als berekend in overeenstemming met subparagraaf 4.1; en   ![10000053612](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053612)

4.1 Het hellend moment *M*<sub>helling</sub> moet als volgt worden berekend:   ![10000053613](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053613)

4.1.1 *M*<sub>passagier</sub> is het maximum veronderstelde hellend moment als gevolg van de verplaatsing van passagiers, en moet als volgt worden verkregen:   ![10000053614](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053614)
waarbij: *N <sub>p</sub>* het maximum toegestane aantal passagiers aan boord is in de bedrijfstoestand die overeenkomt met de diepste indelingsdiepgang in kwestie; en *B* de breedte van het schip is. Als alternatief mag het hellend moment worden berekend met de aanname dat de passagiers over de beschikbare dekoppervlakken zijn verdeeld met 4 personen per vierkante meter aan een zijde van het schip op de dekken waar de verzamelplaatsen zijn gelegen en op zodanige wijze dat het ongunstigste hellende moment wordt bereikt. Hierbij moet worden uitgegaan van een gewicht van 75 kg per passagier.  

4.1.2 *M*<sub>wind</sub> is de maximum aangenomen windkracht die op een beschadigingsscenario van invloed is:   ![10000053615](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053615)
waarbij:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
|  *P*   | =  | 120 N/m <sup>2</sup>;  |
|  *A*   | =  | geprojecteerde laterale oppervlak boven de waterlijn;  |
|  *Z*   | =  | afstand van het midden van het geprojecteerde laterale oppervlak boven de waterlijn tot *T/2*; en  |
|  *T*   | =  | diepgang *d <sub>i</sub>* van het schip.  |

4.1.3 *M*<sub>Reddingsboot/-vlot</sub> is het maximum veronderstelde hellend moment ten gevolge van tewaterlating van alle volle strijkbare reddingsboten/-vlotten aan een zijde van het schip. Dit wordt berekend met gebruikmaking van de volgende aannames: 

.1 alle reddingsboten en hulpverleningsboten, geplaatst aan de zijde waarnaar het schip slagzij heeft gemaakt na schade te hebben geleden, worden geacht volgeladen naar buiten te zijn gedraaid en gereed om te worden gevierd;  

.2 voor reddingsboten die zijn bedoeld om volgeladen vanuit de opstellingsplaats te water te worden gelaten, wordt het maximale hellende moment gedurende de tewaterlating genomen;  

.3 een volgeladen strijkbaar reddingsvlot, bevestigd aan elke davit aan de zijde waarnaar het schip slagzij heeft gemaakt na schade te hebben geleden, wordt geacht gereed om te worden gevierd naar buiten te zijn gedraaid;  

.4 personen die zich niet in de naar buiten gedraaide reddingsmiddelen bevinden, brengen geen verschuiving van het hellende moment of het herstellende moment teweeg; en  

.5 reddingsmiddelen aan de andere zijde van het schip dan die waarnaar het schip slagzij heeft gemaakt, worden geacht te zijn weggeborgen.         
5.  Onsymmetrisch vollopen moet worden beperkt tot een met een doelmatige indeling verenigbaar minimum. Indien het noodzakelijk is grote hellingshoeken te corrigeren, moeten de middelen daartoe, indien zulks uitvoerbaar is, automatisch werken, doch wanneer bedieningsmiddelen voor overvloei-inrichtingen aanwezig zijn, moeten deze in ieder geval van boven het schottendek bediend kunnen worden. Deze installaties en hun bedieningsmiddelen moeten voor de Administratie aanvaardbaar zijn. Aan de kapitein van het schip moet deugdelijke informatie worden verstrekt met betrekking tot het gebruik van de overvloei-inrichtingen. <sup> 5)  Verwezen wordt naar de Aanbeveling inzake een standaardmethode ter vaststelling dat wordt voldaan aan de voorschriften omtrent voorzieningen betreffende overvloei-inrichtingen op passagiersschepen, door de Organisatie aangenomen bij resolutie A.266(VIII), zoals mogelijk wordt gewijzigd.  </sup> 

5.1 Tanks en afdelingen die bij dit overvloeien worden gebruikt moeten zijn uitgerust met luchtpijpen of gelijkwaardige middelen van voldoende diameter om ervoor te zorgen dat het instromen van water in de overvloeiafdelingen niet wordt vertraagd.  

5.2 In alle gevallen moet voor *s <sub>i</sub>* nihil als waarde worden gehanteerd in die gevallen waarbij de waterlijn in de eindtoestand, rekening houdend met inzinken, slagzij en trim, leidt tot onderdompeling van: 

.1 de laagste rand van openingen waardoor geleidelijk vollopen kan plaatsvinden en dit vollopen niet is meegeteld bij de berekening van de factor *s <sub>i</sub>*. Onder deze openingen worden begrepen luchtpijpen, ventilatoren en openingen die worden afgesloten met waterdichte deuren of luiken; en  

.2 de delen van het schottendek op een passagiersschip die ten behoeve van de naleving van Hoofdstuk II-2 worden aangemerkt als een horizontale evacuatieroute.    

5.3 De factor *s <sub>i</sub>* moet op nihil worden gesteld indien zich, met inachtneming van inzinken, slagzij en trim, in enig tussenstadium of in het eindstadium van vollopen een van de volgende feiten voordoen: 

.1 vollopen van een verticaal ontsnappingsluik in het schottendek bestemd voor de naleving van Hoofdstuk II-2;  

.2 het ontoegankelijk of onbruikbaar worden van bedieningsorganen voor waterdichte deuren, overvloei-inrichtingen, kleppen op pijpleidingen of ventilatiekanalen bestemd om de integriteit van de waterdichte schotten van boven het schottendek te handhaven;  

.3 vollopen van een deel van de pijpleidingen of ventilatiekanalen die door een waterdichte begrenzing lopen, gelegen binnen een afdeling opgenomen in de schadescenario’s die bijdragen aan de bereikte index *A*, indien deze niet bij elke begrenzing van waterdichte afsluitmiddelen zijn voorzien.    

5.4 Echter, wanneer bij de lekstabiliteitsberekening rekening wordt gehouden met de afdelingen die verondersteld worden geleidelijk te zijn ondergelopen, mogen uiteenlopende waarden van *s*<sub>tussenliggend,i</sub> worden berekend, onder de aanname dat bij latere fasen van vollopen overvloeimaatregelen worden getroffen.  

5.5 Behoudens voor zover bepaald in paragraaf 5.3.1 behoeft geen rekening te worden gehouden met openingen die worden gesloten door middel van waterdichte luiken en verzonken stortranden, kleine waterdichte luiken, op afstand bediende waterdichte schuifdeuren, patrijspoorten van het niet-openende type alsmede waterdichte toegangsdeuren en luiken die op zee gesloten moeten blijven.     
6.  Wanneer boven de waterlijn in kwestie horizontale waterdichte begrenzingen zijn aangebracht, wordt de s-waarde van de lagere afdeling of groep van afdelingen berekend door vermenigvuldiging van de in paragraaf 1.1 bepaalde waarde met de in paragraaf 6.1 bedoelde reductiefactor *v <sub>m</sub>*, die de kans voorstelt dat de ruimten boven de horizontale afdeling niet zullen vollopen. 

6.1 De factor *v <sub>m</sub>* wordt verkregen door de volgende formule:   ![10000053616](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053616)
waarbij: *H <sub>j</sub>*, *<sub>n</sub>*, *<sub>m</sub>* de geringste hoogte boven de basislijn is, in meters, binnen het lengtebereik van *x <sub>1</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub>... *x <sub>2</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub> van de m <sup>e</sup> horizontale begrenzing waarvan wordt aangenomen dat deze de verticale mate van vollopen ten aanzien van de beschadigde afdelingen in kwestie beperkt; *H <sub>j</sub>*<sub>,</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>,</sub>*<sub>m</sub>*<sub>-1</sub> de geringste hoogte boven de basislijn is, in meters, binnen het lengtebereik van *x <sub>1</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub>... *x <sub>2</sub>*<sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub> van de (m-1) <sup>e</sup> horizontale begrenzing waarvan wordt aangenomen dat deze de verticale mate van vollopen van de beschadigde afdelingen in kwestie beperkt; *j* het achterste einde van de beschadigde afdelingen in kwestie is; *m* elke horizontale begrenzing is, geteld naar boven toe vanaf de waterlijn in kwestie; *d* de diepgang in kwestie is als omschreven in voorschrift 2; en *x <sub>1</sub>* en *x <sub>2</sub>* de einden voorstellen van de afdeling of groep van afdelingen die in voorschrift 7-1 worden besproken. 

6.1.1 De factoren *v* (*H <sub>j</sub>*, *<sub>n</sub>*, *<sub>m</sub>*, *d*) en *v* (*H <sub>j</sub>*, *<sub>n</sub>*, *<sub>m</sub>*<sub>-1</sub>, *d*) worden verkregen via de volgende formules:   ![10000053617](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053617)
waarbij: voor *v* (*H <sub>j</sub>*, *<sub>n</sub>*, *<sub>m</sub>*, *d*) 1 moet worden aangehouden, indien *H <sub>m</sub>* samenvalt met de hoogste waterdichte begrenzing van het schip binnen het bereik (*x* 1 <sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>)</sub>... *x* 2 <sub>(</sub>*<sub>j</sub>*<sub>+</sub>*<sub>n</sub>*<sub>-1)</sub>), en voor *v* (*H <sub>j</sub>*, *<sub>n</sub>*<sub>,</sub>*<sub>0</sub>*, *d*) 0 moet worden aangehouden.   In geen enkel geval mag voor v <sub>m</sub> minder dan 0 of meer dan 1 worden aangehouden.  

6.2 In het algemeen wordt elke bijdrage *dA* aan index *A* in het geval van horizontale afdelingen, verkregen door middel van de volgende formule:   ![10000053618](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053618)
waarbij: *v <sub>m</sub>* = de in overeenstemming met paragraaf 6.1 berekende *v* -waarde; *s*<sub>min</sub> = de geringste *s* -factor voor alle combinaties van beschadiging verkregen wanneer de veronderstelde beschadiging zich vanaf de veronderstelde beschadigingshoogte *H <sub>m</sub>* naar beneden toe uitstrekt.     

### Voorschrift  7-3  

####Permeabiliteit

1.  Voor het maken van de berekeningen voor de waterdichte indeling en lekstabiliteit van de voorschriften, is de permeabiliteit van elke algemene afdeling of deel van een afdeling als volgt:  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Ruimten  | Permeabiliteit  |
| Bestemd voor voorraden  | 0,60  |
| Ingenomen door verblijven  | 0,95  |
| Ingenomen door machines  | 0,85  |
| Lege ruimten  | 0,95  |
| Bestemd voor vloeistoffen  | 0 of 0,95 <sup>1)</sup>  |

<sup>1)</sup> Welke van de twee leidt tot het meest strikte vereiste.   
2.  Voor het maken van de berekeningen voor de waterdichte indeling en lekstabiliteit van de voorschriften, is de permeabiliteit van elke ladingafdeling of deel van een afdeling als volgt:  

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Ruimten  | Permeabiliteit  bij diepgang *d*<sub>s</sub>  | Permeabiliteit  bij diepgang *d*<sub>p</sub>  | Permeabiliteit  bij diepgang *d*<sub>l</sub>  |
| Droge laadruimten  | 0,70  | 0,80  | 0,95  |

### Voorschrift  8  

####Bijzondere vereisten betreffende de stabiliteit van passagiersschepen

1.  Een passagiersschip bedoeld voor het vervoer van 400 personen of meer moet een zodanige waterdichte indeling achter het aanvaringsschot hebben dat *s <sub>i</sub>*<sub></sub>= 1 voor de drie beladingstoestanden waarop de berekening van de indelingsindex is gebaseerd en voor een beschadiging die alle afdelingen treft binnen 0,08 *L*, gemeten vanaf de voorste loodlijn.   
2.  Een passagiersschip bedoeld voor het vervoer van 36 personen of meer moet in staat zijn een beschadiging, van de in paragraaf 3 vermelde omvang, langs de zijhuid te weerstaan. Naleving van dit voorschrift wordt behaald door aan te tonen dat *s <sub>i</sub>*, als omschreven in voorschrift 7-2, ten minste 0,9 bedraagt bij de drie beladingstoestanden waarop de berekening van de indelingsindex is gebaseerd.   
3.  De omvang van de beschadiging die moet worden aangenomen bij het aantonen van de naleving van paragraaf 2, moet zodanig afhankelijk zijn van *N* als omschreven in voorschrift 6, en van *L <sub>s</sub>* als omschreven in voorschrift 2, dat: 

.1 de verticale omvang van de beschadiging zich uitstrekt van de basislijn van het schip volgens de mal naar een positie tot 12,5 m boven de positie van de diepste indelingsdiepgang als omschreven in voorschrift 2, tenzij een geringere verticale omvang van de beschadiging een lagere waarde van *s <sub>i</sub>* oplevert, in welk geval deze geringere omvang moet worden gehanteerd;  

.2 wanneer 400 personen of meer moeten worden vervoerd, een lengte van de beschadiging van 0,03 *L <sub>s</sub>*, doch niet minder dan 3 m moet worden aangenomen op enige positie langs de zijhuid, in combinatie met een penetratie naar binnen toe van 0,1 *B*, doch niet geringer dan 0,75 m, gemeten vanaf zijkant schip naar binnen toe, onder een rechte hoek tot aan hart schip op het niveau van de diepste indelingsdiepgang;  

.3 wanneer minder dan 400 personen worden vervoerd, een lengte van de beschadiging op elke positie langs de zijhuid moet worden aangenomen tussen waterdichte dwarsschotten, mits de afstand tussen twee aangrenzende waterdichte dwarsschotten niet minder bedraagt dan de aangenomen lengte van de beschadiging. Indien de afstand tussen aangrenzende waterdichte dwarsschotten minder dan de aangenomen lengte van de beschadiging is mag slechts een van deze schotten worden aangemerkt als doeltreffend ten behoeve van het aantonen van de naleving van paragraaf 2.  

.4 wanneer 36 personen worden vervoerd, een lengte van de beschadiging van 0,015 *Ls*, doch niet minder dan 3 m moet worden aangenomen, in combinatie met een penetratie naar binnen toe van 0,05 *B*, doch niet minder dan 0,75 m; en  

.5 wanneer meer dan 36, maar minder dan 400 personen worden vervoerd, de waarden van de lengte van de beschadiging en de penetratie naar binnen toe, die bij de berekening van de aangenomen schadeomvang worden gebruikt, moeten worden verkregen door middel van lineaire interpolatie tussen de waarden van de lengte van de beschadiging en de penetratie die van toepassing zijn op schepen die 36 of 400 personen vervoeren als vermeld in de subparagrafen .4 en .2.

####Dubbele bodems in passagiersschepen en andere vrachtschepen dan tankschepen

1.  Er moet een dubbele bodem zijn aangebracht die zich uitstrekt van het aanvaringsschot tot het achterpiekschot, voor zover dit uitvoerbaar en verenigbaar is met de inrichting en het goed functioneren van het schip.   
2.  Waar het aanbrengen van een dubbele bodem is voorgeschreven, moet de binnenste bodem hiervan op zodanige hoogte op de huid in de zijden van het schip aansluiten, dat de bodem van het schip tot de ronding van de kimmen beschermd is. Een dergelijke bescherming wordt als voldoende aangemerkt wanneer de binnenste bodem op geen enkel punt lager is dan een parallel vlak met de kiellijn gelegen op een verticale afstand van ten minste *h,* gemeten vanaf de kiellijn, zoals berekend via de formule: *h* = *B* /20 In geen geval mag de waarde van *h* evenwel minder bedragen dan 760 mm en er hoeft geen grotere waarde te worden aangehouden dan 2000 mm.   
3.  Kleine in de dubbele bodem aangebrachte lensputten, in verband met afvoermaatregelen van laadruimen, etc., mogen niet dieper zijn dan nodig is. In het achtergedeelte van een astunnel mag een lensput echter tot de huid doorlopen. Andere putten (bijvoorbeeld voor het opvangen van smeerolie onder de hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen) kunnen worden toegelaten, indien de Administratie van oordeel is dat de bescherming vergelijkbaar is met die welke een dubbele bodem die voldoet aan dit voorschrift biedt. In geen geval mag de verticale afstand van de bodem van een dergelijke put naar een met de kiel samenvallend vlak minder dan 500 mm bedragen.   
4.  Ter plaatse van waterdichte tanks, met inbegrip van droge tanks van gemiddelde inhoud, behoeft geen dubbele bodem te worden aangebracht, mits de veiligheid van het schip niet in gevaar komt bij bodem- of zijschade.   
5.  Voor passagiersschepen waarop de bepalingen van voorschrift 1.5 van toepassing zijn en die een geregelde lijndienst onderhouden binnen de begrenzing van een korte internationale reis, zoals omschreven in voorschrift III/3.22, kan de Administratie ontheffing verlenen van het vereiste van een dubbele bodem, indien zij van oordeel is dat het aanbrengen van een dubbele bodem in dat deel niet verenigbaar zou zijn met de inrichting en het goed functioneren van het schip.   
6.  Elk deel van een passagiersschip of een vrachtschip dat niet met een dubbele bodem is uitgerust in overeenstemming met de paragrafen 1, 4 of 5, moet in dat deel van het schip bodemschade kunnen weerstaan, als vermeld in paragraaf 8.   
7.  In het geval van ongebruikelijke bodemvoorzieningen op een passagiersschip of een vrachtschip moet worden aangetoond dat het schip bodemschade kan weerstaan als vermeld in paragraaf 8.   
8.  Naleving van paragraaf 6 of 7 moet worden bereikt door aan te tonen dat *s <sub>i</sub>*, wanneer berekend in overeenstemming met voorschrift 7-2, onder alle bedrijfsomstandigheden niet minder dan 1 bedraagt bij een aangenomen bodemschade op enige positie aan de onderzijde van het schip en met een omvang als vermeld in onderstaande subparagraaf .2 ten aanzien van het beschadigde deel van het schip: 

.1 Vollopen van dergelijke ruimten mag de noodstroom- en lichtvoorzieningen, interne communicatie, signalen of andere noodvoorzieningen in andere delen van het schip niet doen uitvallen.  

.2 Als omvang van de beschadiging moet worden aangenomen:  

|--- | Over 0,3 *L* vanaf de voorloodlijn van het schip  | Elk ander deel van het schip  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Omvang over de horizontale as  | 1/3 *L*<sup>2/3</sup> of 14.5 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  | 1/3 *L*<sup>2/3</sup> of 14,5 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  |
| Dwarsomvang  | *B* /6 of 10 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  | *B* /6 of 5 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  |
| Omvang over de verticale as gemeten vanaf de kiellijn  | *B* /20 of 2 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  | *B* /20 of 2 m, naar gelang welke geringer is  |

.3 Indien een beschadiging van kleinere omvang dan de maximale beschadiging als aangegeven in subparagraaf .2 een ernstiger situatie ten gevolge heeft, moet van een dergelijke beschadiging worden uitgegaan.     
9.  In het geval van grote laaggelegen laadruimen in passagiersschepen mag de Administratie een grotere hoogte van de dubbele bodem verlangen van ten hoogste *B* /10 of 3 m, naar gelang welke minder is, gemeten vanaf de kiellijn. Als alternatief mogen bodembeschadigingen voor deze delen worden berekend in overeenstemming met paragraaf 8, maar uitgaande van een grotere omvang over de verticale as.   

### Voorschrift  10  

####Constructie van waterdichte schotten

1.  Elk schot van de waterdichte indeling, hetzij dwars- dan wel langsscheeps, moet geconstrueerd zijn met verbanddelen als omschreven in voorschrift 2.17. In alle gevallen moeten schotten van de waterdichte indeling ten minste de druk kunnen weerstaan die ontstaat wanneer tot aan het schottendek water staat.   
2.  Trapsgewijze sprongen en nissen in waterdichte schotten moeten zo sterk zijn als het schot ter plaatse hiervan zou moeten zijn.   

### Voorschrift  11  

####Eerste beproeving van waterdichte schotten, enz.

1.  Het beproeven van waterdichte ruimten die niet bestemd zijn voor vloeistoffen en laadruimen bestemd voor ballast door deze met water te vullen, is niet verplicht. Indien geen beproeving door het vullen met water plaatsvindt, moet de waterdichtheid waar mogelijk door bespuiting worden aangetoond. Deze bespuiting moet worden uitgevoerd in de meest gevorderde staat van afwerking van het schip. Wanneer beproeving door middel van bespuiting niet mogelijk is in verband met de mogelijke beschadiging van machine-installaties, isolatie van elektrische apparatuur of uitrusting, mag dit worden vervangen door een zorgvuldige visuele controle van de gelaste verbindingen, waar nodig ondersteund door middelen als een verfabsorptietest, een ultrasone lekkagetest of een vergelijkbare testmethode. In elk geval moeten de waterdichte schotten zorgvuldig worden onderzocht.   
2.  De voorpiek, de dubbele bodem (met inbegrip van kokerkielen) en binnenhuid moeten worden beproefd tot een waterdruk overeenkomstig de vereisten van paragraaf 10.1.   
3.  Tanks bestemd om vloeistoffen te bevatten en die deel uitmaken van de waterdichte indeling van het schip, moeten op stevigheid en structurele sterkte worden beproefd tot een waterdruk die overeenkomt met de ontwerpdruk. Het niveau van het water mag in geen geval lager zijn dan de bovenzijde van de luchtpijpen of tot 2,4 m boven de bovenzijde van de tank, naar gelang welke hoger is.   
4.  De beproevingen bedoeld in de paragrafen 2 en 3 hebben ten doel de waterdichtheid te verzekeren van de constructies behorende tot de waterdichte indeling en moeten niet beschouwd worden als beproevingen ter vaststelling of een afdeling geschikt is voor het innemen van brandstofolie of voor andere bijzondere doeleinden waartoe een zwaardere beproeving kan worden geëist afhankelijk van tot welke hoogte de vloeistof in de tank of haar aansluitingen kan stijgen.   

### Voorschrift  12  

####Piekschotten, schotten welke het voortstuwingsgedeelte begrenzen, astunnels, enz.

1.  Er dient een aanvaringsschot te worden aangebracht dat waterdicht is tot aan het schottendek. Dit schot moet zich bevinden op een afstand van de voorloodlijn van ten minste 0,05 *L* of 10 meter, welke van beide het kleinst is, en tenzij door de Administratie toegestaan ten hoogste 0,08 *L* of 0,05 *L* + 3 m, welke van beide het grootst is.   
2.  Wanneer enig deel van het schip onder de waterlijn doorloopt tot vóór de voorloodlijn, zoals een bulbsteven, dienen de in paragraaf 1 vastgestelde afstanden te worden gemeten vanaf een punt, hetzij: 

.1 halverwege de lengte van een zodanige voortzetting;  

.2 op een afstand van 0,015 *L* van de voorloodlijn naar voren toe; hetzij  

.3 op een afstand van 3 m van de voorloodlijn naar voren toe,   naar gelang welk punt de kleinste afstand oplevert.   
3.  In het schot mogen trapsgewijze sprongen of nissen zijn aangebracht, mits deze blijven binnen de grenzen voorgeschreven in paragraaf 1 of 2.   
4.  In het aanvaringsschot onder het schottendek mogen geen deuren, mangaten, toegangsopeningen, ventilatiekanalen of andere openingen zijn aangebracht.   
5.1.  Tenzij voorzien in paragraaf 5.2, mag het aanvaringsschot onder het schottendek, wanneer de voorpiektank voor vloeistoffen wordt gebruikt, slechts door een pijp doorboord zijn; de pijp moet voorzien zijn van een afsluiter met neerschroefbare klep welke van boven het schottendek kan worden bediend en in de voorpiek tegen het aanvaringsschot is bevestigd. De Administratie kan echter toestaan dat deze afsluiter aan de achterzijde van het aanvaringsschot wordt bevestigd, mits de afsluiter onder alle bedrijfsomstandigheden goed toegankelijk is en de ruimte waarin hij is aangebracht geen laadruimte is. Alle afsluiters dienen te zijn vervaardigd van staal, brons of ander goedgekeurd vormbaar materiaal. Kleppen van gewoon gietijzer of van een soortgelijk materiaal zijn niet toegestaan.   
5.2.  Indien de voorpiek is onderverdeeld voor de berging van twee verschillende soorten vloeistoffen kan de Administratie toestaan dat het aanvaringsschot onder het schottendek door twee pijpen wordt doorboord, elk voorzien van een afsluiter op de wijze zoals in paragraaf 5.1 is voorgeschreven, en indien de Administratie overtuigd is dat er geen andere praktische oplossing mogelijk is voor het bevestigen van deze tweede pijp en dat gelet op de onderverdeling van de voorpiek de veiligheid van het schip gehandhaafd blijft.   
6.  Indien het schip een lange bovenbouw op het voorschip heeft, moet het aanvaringsschot doorlopen tot het dek boven het schottendek en aldaar dicht zijn tegen weer en wind. Deze verlenging behoeft niet onmiddellijk boven het eronder geplaatste schot te worden aangebracht, mits deze is aangebracht binnen de grenzen vermeld in paragraaf 1 of 2, met de uitzondering toegestaan in paragraaf 7 en het gedeelte van het dek dat de trapsgewijze verspringing vormt, dicht is tegen weer en wind. De verlenging moet zodanig worden aangebracht dat de mogelijkheid wordt uitgesloten dat de boegdeur hieraan schade veroorzaakt bij schade aan of losraken van een boegdeur.   
7.  Wanneer boegdeuren zijn aangebracht en een hellende laadoprit deel uitmaakt van de verlenging van het aanvaringsschot boven het schottendek, moet de oprit over de gehele lengte dicht zijn tegen weer en wind. Op vrachtschepen mag het gedeelte van de oprit dat zich op meer dan 2,3 m boven het schottendek bevindt doorlopen tot vóór de in paragraaf 1 of 2 aangegeven grens. Opritten die niet voldoen aan de bovenstaande vereisten worden niet beschouwd als verlenging van het aanvaringsschot.   
8.  Het aantal openingen in de verlenging van het aanvaringsschot boven het vrijboorddek dient te worden beperkt tot het minimum aantal dat verenigbaar is met het ontwerp en het normaal functioneren van het schip. Al deze openingen moeten afsluitbaar zijn tegen weer en wind.   
9.  Er moeten schotten zijn aangebracht die de machineruimte voor en achter scheiden van vracht- en accommodatieruimten en deze moeten waterdicht zijn tot aan het schottendek. Op passagiersschepen moet tevens een achterpiekschot zijn aangebracht en waterdicht tot het schottendek zijn opgetrokken. Het achterpiekschot mag echter beneden het schottendek eindigen, mits daardoor de mate van veiligheid van het schip, wat de waterdichte indeling betreft, niet wordt verminderd.   
10.  De schroefaskokers moeten steeds in waterdichte ruimten van bescheiden inhoud zijn ingesloten. Op passagiersschepen moet de pakkingbus geplaatst zijn binnen een waterdichte astunnel of andere waterdichte ruimte, afgescheiden van de afdeling waarin de schroefaskoker is ingesloten en van zodanige inhoud, dat het schottendek niet onder water komt, wanneer deze ruimte door lekkage van de pakkingbus zou vollopen. Ten aanzien van vrachtschepen kan de Administratie andere maatregelen treffen ter verkleining van het risico dat bij beschadiging van inrichtingen voor schroefaskokers water binnendringt in het schip.   

### Voorschrift  13  

####Openingen in waterdichte schotten onder het schottendek op passagiersschepen

1.  Het aantal openingen in waterdichte schotten moet beperkt zijn tot het minimum dat verenigbaar is met het ontwerp en goed functioneren van het schip; deze openingen moeten van deugdelijke afsluitmiddelen zijn voorzien.   
2.1.  Indien pijpen, spuipijpen, elektrische kabels, enz., door waterdichte schotten zijn gevoerd, moeten voorzieningen zijn getroffen waardoor de waterdichtheid van de schotten verzekerd is.   
2.2.  Afsluiters die geen deel uitmaken van een pijpleidingsysteem, zijn niet toegestaan in waterdichte schotten.   
2.3.  Lood of andere hittegevoelige materialen mogen niet worden toegepast in systemen die door waterdichte schotten gaan, indien beschadiging daarvan in geval van brand de waterdichtheid van de schotten zou kunnen aantasten.   
3.  In waterdichte dwarsschotten die een laadruimte afscheiden van een belendende laadruimte mogen geen deuren, mangaten of toegangsopeningen zijn aangebracht, tenzij voorzien in paragraaf 9.1 en voorschrift 14.   
4.  Onverminderd het bepaalde in paragraaf 10, mogen in ruimten waarin de hoofd- en hulpmachines voor de voortstuwing zijn opgesteld, met inbegrip van de ketels ten behoeve van de voortstuwing, in elk waterdicht schot niet meer dan één deur voorkomen, behoudens de astunneldeuren. Indien twee of meer schroefassen aanwezig zijn, moeten de tunnels door een dwarsverbinding verbonden zijn. Er mag in de machineruimte slechts één deur zijn naar de tunnels wanneer twee schroefassen zijn aangebracht, en slechts twee deuren wanneer meer dan twee schroefassen aanwezig zijn. Al deze deuren moeten schuifdeuren zijn en zodanig zijn aangebracht, dat de bovenkant van de drempels zo hooggelegen is als praktisch mogelijk is. Deze deuren moeten van boven het schottendek buiten de ruimten waarin de machines zijn opgesteld handmatig bediend kunnen worden.   
5.1.  Waterdichte deuren, behalve als voorzien in paragraaf 9.1 of in voorschrift 14, moeten elektrisch bediende schuifdeuren zijn die voldoen aan de eisen van paragraaf 7 en in ten hoogste 60 seconden bij rechtliggend schip vanaf het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug gelijktijdig gesloten kunnen worden.   
5.2.  De bediening van waterdichte schuifdeuren, ongeacht of zij werktuiglijk of met handkracht worden bediend, moet zodanig zijn, dat de deur nog kan worden gesloten wanneer het schip tegen een hellingshoek van 15 graden, ongeacht naar welke zijde slagzij heeft gemaakt. Tevens dient rekening te worden gehouden met de krachten die op een van beide zijden van de deur kunnen werken, zoals wanneer water door de opening stroomt, waarbij een statische drukhoogte ontstaat die gelijk is aan een waterhoogte van ten minste 1 m boven de drempel ter plaatse van de hartlijn van de deur.   
5.3.  Bedieningsinrichtingen van waterdichte deuren, met inbegrip van hydraulische leidingen en elektrische kabels, moeten zo dicht als praktisch mogelijk is bij het schot waarin de deuren zich bevinden, zijn aangebracht, teneinde de kans dat zij betrokken raken bij enige vorm van schade die het schip kan ondervinden, te minimaliseren. Waterdichte deuren en de bedieningsinrichtingen daarvan moeten zodanig zijn aangebracht, dat indien het schip schade ondervindt binnen een vijfde van de breedte van het schip als omschreven in voorschrift 2, waarbij de afstand loodrecht op de hartlijn ter hoogte van de diepste indelingsdiepgang wordt gemeten, de bediening van de waterdichte deuren buiten het beschadigde gedeelte van het schip niet nadelig wordt beïnvloed.   
6.  Alle werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeuren moeten zijn voorzien van standaanwijzers die op plaatsen waar een deur op afstand kan worden bediend, aangeven of de deuren geopend dan wel gesloten zijn. Plaatsen waar de deuren op afstand kunnen worden bediend, mogen slechts zijn gelegen op de brug, zoals voorgeschreven in paragraaf 7.1.5, en op de plaats waar bediening met de hand boven het schottendek is voorgeschreven krachtens paragraaf 7.1.4.   
7.1.  Elke werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeur: 

.1 moet horizontaal of verticaal bewegen;  

.2 moet, behoudens het bepaalde in paragraaf 10, in principe een vrije openingsbreedte hebben van maximaal 1,2 m. De Administratie mag bredere deuren slechts toestaan voor zover zulks noodzakelijk wordt geacht voor goed functioneren van het schip mits andere veiligheidsmaatregelen, met inbegrip van de onderstaande, in acht worden genomen: 

.1 bijzondere aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de sterkte van de deur en de afsluitmiddelen daarvan, teneinde lekkages te voorkomen; en  

.2 de deur moet zijn gelegen binnen de beschadigingszone van *B* /5;    

.3 moet zijn uitgerust met de nodige voorzieningen om de deur te openen en te sluiten met gebruikmaking van elektrische of hydraulische aandrijving, dan wel van enige andere door de Administratie goedgekeurde aandrijving;  

.4 moet zijn voorzien van een afzonderlijke bewegingsinrichting voor handbediening. De deur moet niet alleen ter plaatse aan beide zijden met handkracht kunnen worden geopend en gesloten, maar ook vanaf een toegankelijke plaats boven het schottendek kunnen worden gesloten door middel van een handwiel of ronddraaiende kruk, of een andere door de Administratie aanvaarde inrichting die dezelfde veiligheid biedt. De draairichting of andere beweging moet op alle plaatsen voor de bediening duidelijk worden aangegeven. De deur moet bij rechtliggend schip door handbediening in niet meer dan 90 seconden volledig kunnen worden gesloten;  

.5 moet zijn voorzien van een zodanige bewegingsinrichting dat de deur aan beide zijden werktuiglijk kan worden geopend en werktuiglijk kan worden gesloten en kan worden gesloten vanaf het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug;  

.6 moet zijn voorzien van een geluidssignaal, te onderscheiden van andere geluidssignalen in de omgeving, dat telkens wanneer de deur op afstand werktuiglijk wordt gesloten, gedurende ten minste 5 tot ten hoogste 10 seconden voordat de deur begint te bewegen, klinkt en moet blijven klinken totdat de deur volledig gesloten is. Wanneer de deur met handbediening op afstand wordt gesloten, is het voldoende dat het geluidssignaal slechts klinkt zolang de deur beweegt. Aanvullend kan de Administratie voorschrijven dat het geluidssignaal in passagiersruimten en in ruimten met veel omgevingsgeluid wordt aangevuld met een intermitterend visueel signaal op de deur; en  

.7 moet, indien werktuiglijk bewogen, een min of meer uniforme sluitingstijd hebben. De tijd die het sluiten vergt, vanaf het tijdstip waarop de deur begint te bewegen totdat deze volledig gesloten is, mag bij rechtliggend schip nimmer minder dan 20 seconden of meer dan 40 seconden bedragen.     
7.2.  Het voor het bedienen van de werktuiglijke waterdichte schuifdeuren benodigde vermogen moet worden geleverd via het noodschakelbord, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via een uitsluitend voor dit doel ingericht verdeelbord boven het schottendek. De bijbehorende circuits van de bediening, standaanwijzing en signalering moeten worden gevoed via het noodschakelbord, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij via een uitsluitend voor dit doel ingericht verdeelbord boven het schottendek en zij moeten automatisch kunnen worden gevoed door de tijdelijke elektrische noodkrachtbron, voorgeschreven in paragraaf 3.1.3 van voorschrift 42, bij een storing van de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron of de noodkrachtbron.   
7.3.  Werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeuren moeten zijn voorzien van: 

.1 een centraal bediend hydraulisch systeem met twee onafhankelijke krachtbronnen, elk bestaande uit een motor en een pomp die alle deuren tegelijkertijd kunnen sluiten. Bovendien moeten er voor het gehele systeem hydraulische buffervaten aanwezig zijn met voldoende capaciteit om alle deuren ten minste driemaal te bewegen: sluiten – openen – sluiten tegen een helling van 15º. Deze bedieningscyclus moet kunnen worden uitgevoerd wanneer het buffervat op de inschakeldruk van de pomp is. Bij de keuze van de te gebruiken vloeistof moet rekening worden gehouden met de temperaturen waaraan het systeem in de praktijk zou kunnen worden blootgesteld. Het werktuiglijke bedieningssysteem moet zodanig ontworpen zijn dat de mogelijkheid van een storing in de hydraulische leidingen die de bediening van meer dan één deur nadelig beïnvloedt, zo klein mogelijk is. Het hydraulische systeem moet zijn voorzien van een waarschuwingssysteem voor een te laag vloeistofpeil in de hydraulische vloeistoftanks van de werktuiglijke bedieningsinrichting en voor een te lage gasdruk of andere doeltreffende middelen die verlies van opgeslagen energie in hydraulische buffervaten signaleren. Deze waarschuwingssystemen moeten zowel hoorbare als zichtbare signalen geven en zijn aangebracht op het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug; of  

.2 een onafhankelijk hydraulisch systeem voor elke deur, waarvan de krachtbron bestaat uit een motor en een pomp die de deur kunnen openen en sluiten. Bovendien moet een hydraulisch buffervat aanwezig zijn met voldoende capaciteit om de deur ten minste driemaal te bewegen: sluiten – openen – sluiten tegen een helling van 15°. Deze bedieningscyclus moet kunnen worden uitgevoerd wanneer het buffervat op de inschakeldruk van de pomp is. Bij de keuze van de te gebruiken vloeistof moet rekening worden gehouden met de temperaturen waaraan het systeem in de praktijk zou kunnen worden blootgesteld. Het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug moet zijn uitgerust met een groepswaarschuwingssysteem voor te lage gasdruk of andere doeltreffende middelen die verlies van opgeslagen energie in hydraulische buffervaten signaleren. Verlies van opgeslagen energie moet ook bij de bediening ter plaatse worden aangegeven; of  

.3 een onafhankelijk elektrisch systeem en een motor voor elke deur, waarvan de krachtbron bestaat uit een motor die de deur kan openen en sluiten. De krachtbron moet automatisch kunnen worden gevoed door de tijdelijke elektrische noodkrachtbron, voorgeschreven in paragraaf 4.2 van voorschrift 42, in geval van storing van de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron of de elektrische noodkrachtbron, met voldoende capaciteit om de deur driemaal te bewegen: sluiten – openen, sluiten tegen een helling van 15°. Voor de in de paragrafen 7.3.1, 7.3.2. en 7.3.3 omschreven systemen moeten de volgende voorzieningen worden getroffen: krachtinstallaties voor werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeuren moeten gescheiden zijn van iedere andere krachtinstallatie. Een storing in de elektrisch of hydraulisch aangedreven werktuiglijke bedieningssystemen, met uitzondering van het hydraulische activeringssysteem, mag de handbediening nooit verhinderen.     
7.4.  Aan beide zijden van het schot moeten op ten minste 1,6 m boven het vloeroppervlak bedieningshandgrepen zodanig zijn aangebracht, dat personen die door de deuropening gaan deze beide handgrepen in de openingsstand kunnen houden, zonder dat het werktuiglijk aangedreven sluitingsmechanisme daarbij in werking kan worden gesteld. De bewegingsrichting van de handgrepen voor het openen en sluiten van de deur moet overeenkomen met de bewegingsrichting van de deur en duidelijk zijn aangegeven.   
7.5.  De elektrische uitrusting en de onderdelen voor waterdichte deuren moeten, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, boven het schottendek en buiten gevaarlijke zones en ruimten gelegen zijn.   
7.6.  De behuizingen van elektrische onderdelen die noodzakelijkerwijs onder het schottendek zijn gelegen, moeten afdoende bescherming bieden tegen binnendringend water. <sup> 7)  Zie de volgende publicatie – 529(1976) – van de Internationale Elektrotechnische Commissie:    .1  elektrische motoren, bijbehorende circuits en bedieningsonderdelen; beschermd volgens norm IPX 7;    .2  standaanwijzers van deuren en bijbehorende onderdelen van circuits; beschermd volgens norm IPX 8; en    .3  waarschuwingssignalen voor de beweging van deuren; beschermd volgens norm IPX 6.     Andere uitvoeringen voor de behuizingen van elektrische onderdelen mogen worden toegepast, mits ten genoegen van de Administratie wordt aangetoond dat een gelijkwaardige bescherming wordt bereikt. De waterdruk voor norm IPX 8 moet worden gebaseerd op de druk die in volgelopen toestand gedurende 36 uur kan voorkomen op de plaats van het onderdeel.  </sup>   
7.7.  De circuits voor de elektrische aandrijving, bediening, standaanwijzing en alarmering moeten zodanig tegen defecten zijn beschermd, dat een storing in een circuit van een deur niet leidt tot een storing in dat van een andere deur. Kortsluiting of andere defecten in de circuits voor alarmering of standaanwijzing van een deur mogen de werktuiglijke bediening van die deur niet nadelig beïnvloeden. De voorzieningen moeten zodanig zijn, dat lekkage van water in de onder het schottendek gelegen elektrische installatie er niet toe leidt dat de deur geopend wordt.   
7.8.  Een elektrische storing in het bedienings- of controlesysteem van een werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeur mag er niet toe leiden dat een gesloten deur wordt geopend. De beschikbaarheid van de krachtvoorziening moet constant worden gecontroleerd op een punt in het elektrische circuit zo dicht mogelijk bij de in paragraaf 7.3 voorgeschreven motoren. Bij het uitvallen van een dergelijke krachtvoorziening moet op het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug een hoorbaar en zichtbaar alarm worden geactiveerd.   
8.1.  Het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug moet zijn uitgerust met een „master mode”-schakelaar met twee standen: een „bediening ter plaatse” stand, waarin elke deur na gebruik ter plaatse kan worden geopend en gesloten, zonder automatische sluiting, en een „deuren sluiten” stand, waarmee elke geopende deur automatisch wordt gesloten. Met de „deuren sluiten” stand wordt elke geopende deur automatisch gesloten. In de stand „deuren sluiten” moeten de deuren ter plaatse kunnen worden geopend en moeten zij automatisch sluiten zodra de bedieningsinrichting ter plaatse wordt losgelaten. De „master mode”-schakelaar dient in principe in de stand „bediening ter plaatse” te staan. De stand „deuren sluiten” mag slechts worden toegepast in geval van nood of voor beproevingsdoeleinden. Bijzondere aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de betrouwbaarheid van de „master mode”-schakelaar.   
8.2.  Het centrale bedieningspaneel op de brug moet zijn voorzien van een overzichtspaneel met de plaats van elke deur, dat door middel van standaanwijzingslampjes aangeeft of een deur geopend of gesloten is. Rood licht geeft aan dat een deur volledig geopend is en groen dat een deur volledig gesloten is. Wanneer een deur op afstand wordt gesloten, wordt de overgangstoestand aangegeven door middel van een rood knipperlicht. Het circuit van de standaanwijzers moet onafhankelijk zijn van het circuit van de bediening van elke deur.   
8.3.  Het mag niet mogelijk zijn een deur op afstand te openen vanaf het centrale bedieningspaneel.   
9.1.  Indien de Administratie overtuigd is dat het aanbrengen van zulke deuren noodzakelijk is, mogen waterdichte deuren van goede constructie worden aangebracht in waterdichte schotten die tussendeks laadruimen van elkaar scheiden. Dergelijke deuren mogen draaideuren, roldeuren of schuifdeuren zijn, doch zij mogen niet op afstand bediend kunnen worden. Zij moeten zijn aangebracht op het hoogste niveau en zo ver van de huidbeplating zijn verwijderd als praktisch mogelijk is; in geen geval mag een van de verticale zijden zijn gelegen op een afstand van de huidbeplating die minder is dan één vijfde van de breedte van het schip als omschreven in voorschrift 2, waarbij de afstand loodrecht op het vlak van kiel en stevens ter hoogte van de diepste indelingsdiepgang wordt gemeten.   
9.2.  Indien een of meer van deze deuren gedurende de reis toegankelijk zijn, moeten zij zijn voorzien van een middel dat onbevoegd openen voorkomt. Wanneer men dergelijke deuren wenst aan te brengen, moet de Administratie het aantal en de plaatsing daarvan aan een speciaal onderzoek onderwerpen.   
10.  Wegneembare platen in schotten mogen slechts in machineruimten worden toegepast. De Administratie kan ten hoogste één werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeur in elk waterdicht schot in plaats van deze wegneembare platen toestaan die breder is dan de in paragraaf 7.1.2. bedoelde deuren, mits deze deuren tijdens de vaart gesloten blijven, behalve wanneer opening, naar het oordeel van de kapitein, dringend noodzakelijk is. Deze deuren behoeven niet te voldoen aan het bepaalde in paragraaf 7.1.4. betreffende volledig handmatig sluiten binnen 90 seconden.   
11.1.  Indien verkeersgangen of tunnels voor de verbinding tussen de verblijven voor de bemanning en de stookplaats, voor pijpleidingen of voor enig ander doel door waterdichte schotten leiden, moeten zij waterdicht zijn en voldoen aan de vereisten van voorschrift 16-1. Indien de toegang tot tenminste één uiteinde van een dergelijke tunnel of verkeersgang gedurende de zeereis als doorgang wordt benut, moet deze waterdicht aansluiten aan een schacht, die waterdicht is opgetrokken tot een zodanige hoogte dat deze boven het schottendek toegankelijk is. De toegang tot het andere einde van de verkeersgang of tunnel mag door een waterdichte deur lopen van het op grond van de locatie in het schip vereiste type. Dergelijke verkeersgangen of tunnels mogen niet voeren door het eerste achter het aanvaringsschot gelegen schot dat deel uitmaakt van de waterdichte indeling.   
11.2.  Wanneer wordt voorgesteld tunnels door waterdichte schotten te leiden, dient de Administratie daaraan speciale aandacht te besteden.   
11.3.  Wanneer in verband met gekoelde lading en ventilatie, verkeersgangen of gangen ten behoeve van geforceerde trek door meer dan één waterdicht schot zijn gevoerd, moeten de afsluitmiddelen daarvan werktuiglijk worden bediend en vanaf een centrale plaats boven het schottendek kunnen worden gesloten.   

### Voorschrift  13-1  

####Openingen in waterdichte schotten en binnendekken op vrachtschepen

1.  Het aantal openingen in de waterdichte indelingen moet beperkt zijn tot het minimum dat verenigbaar is met de inrichting en het goed functioneren van het schip. Wanneer doorboringen van waterdichte schoten en binnendekken nodig zijn voor toegang, pijpleidingen, ventilatie, elektrische kabels, enz., moeten voorzieningen worden getroffen om de waterdichtheid te behouden. De Administratie kan een geringere mate van waterdichtheid van openingen boven het vrijboorddek toestaan, indien wordt aangetoond dat elke vorm van geleidelijk vollopen gemakkelijk kan worden beheerst en de veiligheid van het schip niet in gevaar komt.   
2.  Deuren aangebracht om de waterdichtheid van inwendige openingen die op zee worden gebruikt te verzekeren moeten waterdichte schuifdeuren zijn, die vanaf de brug op afstand moeten kunnen worden gesloten en tevens ter plaatse vanaf elke zijde van het schot moeten kunnen worden bediend. Op de bedieningspositie moeten standaanwijzers zijn aangebracht die aanduiden of de deuren geopend of gesloten zijn, en bij het sluiten van de deuren moet een hoorbaar alarm afgaan. De aandrijving, bediening en aanwijzers moeten kunnen worden bediend ingeval de hoofdkrachtbron uitvalt. Bijzondere aandacht moet worden besteed aan het tot een minimum beperken van de gevolgen van de uitval van het bedieningssysteem. Elke werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeur moet zijn voorzien van een afzonderlijke handmatige bedieningsinrichting. De deur moet ter plaatse aan beide zijden van het schot met handkracht kunnen worden geopend en gesloten.   
3.  Toegangsdeuren en toegangsluiken die op zee in principe gesloten blijven, om de waterdichtheid van inwendige openingen te verzekeren, moeten zijn voorzien van middelen die ter plaatse en op de brug aanduiden of deze deuren of luiken open of gesloten zijn. Op alle deuren en luiken moet een mededeling worden aangebracht dat deze niet geopend mogen blijven.   
4.  Indien de Administratie van oordeel is dat waterdichte deuren of opritten noodzakelijk zijn, mogen dergelijke deuren of opritten, van deugdelijke constructie, worden aangebracht om grote laadruimen intern van elkaar te scheiden. Dit mogen scharnierende, rollende of schuivende deuren of opritten zijn, maar ze mogen niet op afstand worden bediend. Indien een of meer van deze deuren of opritten gedurende de reis toegankelijk zijn, moeten zij zijn voorzien van een middel dat onbevoegd openen voorkomt. <sup> 8)  Zie de Interpretaties van voorschriften van deel B-1 van SOLAS Hoofdstuk II-1 (MSC/Circ.651).  </sup>   
5.  Andere afsluitmiddelen die op zee permanent gesloten blijven om de waterdichtheid van inwendige openingen te verzekeren, moeten elk zijn voorzien van een mededeling dat deze gesloten moeten blijven. Op mangaten bevestigd met bouten op kleine steek kan dit achterwege blijven.   

### Voorschrift  14

2.  Uitwendige openingen die in overeenstemming met paragraaf 1 waterdicht moeten zijn, moeten, behoudens de luiken van laadruimen, worden uitgerust met standaanwijzers op de brug.   
3.  Openingen in de huidbeplating onder het dek dat de verticale omvang van de schade begrenst, moeten – indien deze tijdens de reis toegankelijk zijn – zijn voorzien van een middel dat onbevoegd openen belet.   
4.  Andere afsluitmiddelen die op zee permanent gesloten blijven om de waterdichtheid van uitwendige openingen te verzekeren, moeten zijn voorzien van mededeling dat deze gesloten moeten blijven. Op mangaten bevestigd met bouten op kleine steek kan dit achterwege blijven.   

### Voorschrift  16  

####Constructie en eerste beproeving van waterdichte deuren, patrijspoorten, enz.

1.  Op alle schepen: 

.1 moeten de inrichting, de materialen en de constructie van alle waterdichte deuren, patrijspoorten, toegangs- en laadpoorten, kleppen, pijpen, as- en afvalstortkokers die in deze voorschriften zijn vermeld, ten genoegen zijn van de Administratie;  

.2 moeten deze kleppen, deuren en inrichtingen van aanwijzingen zijn voorzien om het juiste gebruik en de grootst mogelijke veiligheid te waarborgen; en  

.3 mogen de drempels onder verticaal bewegende waterdichte deuren geen groef vormen, waarin zich vuil verzamelt dat de goede sluiting van de deur zou kunnen beletten.     
2.  Op passagiersschepen en vrachtschepen moeten waterdichte deuren worden beproefd door middel van een waterdruk die zij zouden kunnen weerstaan in een eindtoestand of tussenstadium van vollopen. Wanneer de beproeving van afzonderlijke deuren vanwege mogelijk beschadiging van de isolatie of de toebehoren niet plaatsvindt, mag in plaats hiervan het prototype van elk type en formaat deur worden beproefd, met een druk die ten minste overeenkomt met de druk die voor de beoogde plaats vereist is. De beproeving van het prototype moet plaatsvinden voordat de deur wordt aangebracht. De installatiemethode en -procedure voor het aanbrengen van de deur aan boord moeten overeenkomen met die van de beproeving van het prototype. Bij het aanbrengen aan boord moet elke deur worden gecontroleerd op goede aansluiting tussen het schot, het kozijn en de deur.   

### Voorschrift  16-1  

####Constructie en eerste beproeving van waterdichte dekken, kokers, enz.

1.  Waterdichte dekken, kokers, tunnels, kokerkielen en luchtschachten moeten even sterk zijn als de waterdichte schotten op overeenkomstige hoogte. De middelen om ze waterdicht te maken en voor de sluiting van openingen daarin, moeten ten genoegen van de Administratie zijn. Waterdichte luchtschachten en kokers moeten op passagiersschepen ten minste tot het schottendek zijn opgetrokken en op vrachtschepen tot het vrijboorddek.   
2.  Indien een ventilatieschacht die door een constructie loopt het schottendek doorkruist, moet de schacht de waterdruk in de schacht kunnen weerstaan, waarbij de maximum toegestane hellingshoek gedurende de verschillende stadia van vollopen, in overeenstemming met voorschrift 7-2 in aanmerking wordt genomen.   
3.  Indien de plaats waar een schacht het schottendek doorkruist zich geheel of ten dele op het belangrijkste ro-ro dek bevindt, moet de schacht de druk kunnen weerstaan die wordt veroorzaakt door interne waterverplaatsing (klotsen) van ingesloten water op het ro-ro dek.   
4.  Na voltooiing moeten de waterdichte dekken door bespuiten of onder water zetten op waterdichtheid beproefd worden en de waterdichte kokers, tunnels en luchtschachten door bespuiten.   

### Voorschrift  17  

####Inwendige waterdichtheid van passagiersschepen boven het schottendek

1.  De Administratie kan eisen dat alle redelijke en praktische maatregelen worden getroffen die het binnendringen en het verspreiden van water boven het schottendek zoveel mogelijk beperken. Zulke maatregelen kunnen gedeeltelijke schotten of raamspanten omvatten. Indien gedeeltelijk waterdichte schotten of raamspanten op het schottendek zijn aangebracht direct boven of in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van waterdichte schotten moeten zij waterdicht op de scheepshuid en op het schottendek aansluiten om het verspreiden van lekwater langs het dek bij slagzij van het schip te beperken. Waar het gedeeltelijk waterdichte schot niet onmiddellijk boven het schot daaronder is opgetrokken, moet het tussengelegen schottendek afdoende waterdicht zijn uitgevoerd. Wanneer openingen, leidingen, spuigaten, elektrische kabels, enzovoort door de gedeeltelijk waterdichte schotten of dekken binnen het ondergelopen deel van het schottendek worden gevoerd, moeten voorzieningen worden getroffen om de waterdichtheid van de structuur boven het schottendek teverzekeren. <sup> 9)  Zie de Richtsnoeren inzake de waterdichtheid van begrenzende schotten boven het schottendek op passagiersschepen voor de juiste toepassing van voorschrift 8 en voorschrift 20, paragraaf 1, van Hoofdstuk II-1 van SOLAS 1974, als gewijzigd (MSC/Circ.541, als kan worden gewijzigd).  </sup>   
2.  Alle openingen in blootgestelde delen van dit open dek moeten van hoofden zijn voorzien van voldoende hoogte en sterkte en van doelmatige middelen om deze snel tegen weer en wind af te sluiten. Waterloospoorten, open railings en spuipijpen moeten zijn aangebracht voor zover noodzakelijk om overgekomen water onder alle weersomstandigheden snel van het open dek af te voeren.   
3.  De open uiteinden van luchtpijpen die eindigen in een bovenbouw moeten zich ten minste 1 m boven de waterlijn bevinden wanneer het schip onder een hoek van 15° slagzij maakt, of de maximum hellingshoek gedurende tussenliggende stadia van vollopen, zoals vastgesteld door middel van directe berekening, naar gelang welke het grootst is. Luchtpijpen uit tanks anders dan olietanks mogen ook eindigen in de zijkant van de bovenbouw. De bepalingen van deze paragraaf laten de bepalingen van het van kracht zijnde [Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md) onverlet.   
4.  Patrijspoorten, toegangs-, laad- en brandstofpoorten en andere afsluitmiddelen voor openingen in de huidbeplating boven het schottendek, moeten deugdelijk ontworpen, geconstrueerd en voldoende sterk zijn, rekening houdend met de ruimten waarin zij zijn aangebracht en met hun plaats ten opzichte van de diepste indelingsdiepgang. <sup> 10)  Zie de Aanbeveling betreffende de sterkte en beveiligings- en afsluitvoorzieningen van in de huid aangebrachte deuren op ro-ro passagiersschepen, door de Organisatie aangenomen bij resolutie A.793(19).  </sup>   
5.  Alle patrijspoorten in ruimten onder het eerste dek boven het schottendek moeten aan de binnenzijde van sterke blinden zijn voorzien, waarmee zij gemakkelijk en doeltreffend waterdicht gesloten kunnen worden.   

### Voorschrift  17-1  

####Waterdichtheid van de romp en bovenbouw, voorkoming van schade en toezicht op ro-ro passagiersschepen

1.1.  Onverminderd de bepalingen van de subparagrafen 1.2 en 1.3, moeten alle toegangen die naar ruimten onder het schottendek leiden een laagste punt hebben dat ten minste 2,5 m boven het schottendek ligt.   
1.2.  Indien voertuigopritten aanwezig zijn voor de toegang tot ruimten onder het schottendek, moeten de openingen hiervan waterdicht tegen weer en wind kunnen worden gesloten ter voorkoming van het binnendringen van water daaronder en zijn voorzien van een alarm- en meldingssysteem ten behoeve van de brug.   
1.3.  De Administratie kan de plaatsing van specifieke toegangen tot de ruimten beneden het schottendek toestaan, mits deze essentieel zijn voor de bedrijfsvoering van het schip, bijvoorbeeld voor de verplaatsing van machines en proviand, en mits deze toegangen waterdicht zijn en voorzien van een alarm- en meldingssysteem op de brug;   
2.  Op de brug moeten aanwijsinstrumenten zijn aangebracht voor alle deuren in de huid, laaddeuren en andere sluitvoorzieningen die, indien zij zijn opengelaten of niet behoorlijk zijn vastgezet, naar de mening van de Administratie zouden kunnen leiden tot het vollopen van een ruimte van bijzondere aard of een ro-ro ruimte. Het systeem van aanwijsinstrumenten moet van een zeer betrouwbaar ontwerp zijn en een visueel signaal geven als de deur niet volledig gesloten is of een vastzetvoorziening niet geplaatst en volledig gesloten is en een geluidssignaal indien een deur of sluitvoorziening opengaat of de vastzetvoorziening losraakt. Het aanwijsinstrumentenpaneel op de brug moet zijn uitgerust met een zodanige keuzefunctie „haven/zeereis” dat een geluidssignaal op de brug afgaat als het schip de haven verlaat terwijl boegdeuren, binnendeuren, hekoprit of andere deuren in de huid niet zijn gesloten of een andere sluitvoorziening zich niet in de juiste stand bevindt. De voeding voor de aanwijsinstrumenten moet onafhankelijk zijn van de voeding voor het bedienen en vastzetten van de deuren.   
3.  Er moet een camerabewakingssysteem en een detectiesysteem voor binnendringend water zijn aangebracht, waarmee de brug en de machinebedieningsplaats worden geattendeerd op binnendringend water via deuren in de boeg of de achtersteven of andere deuren in de huid, dat zou kunnen leiden tot het vollopen van ruimten van bijzondere aard of ro-ro ruimten.

1.  Teneinde zeker te zijn dat de vereiste graad van waterdichte indeling blijft behouden, moet een lastlijn, overeenkomend met de goedgekeurde indelingsdiepgang worden vastgesteld en gemerkt op de zijden van het schip. Op een schip bestemd voor verschillende wijzen van bedrijfsvoering mogen, indien de eigenaar zulks wenst, één of meer extra lastlijnen worden vastgesteld en gemerkt, overeenkomend met de indelingsdiepgangen die de Administratie voor de verschillende bedrijfsconfiguraties kan goedkeuren. Elke aldus goedgekeurde gebruiksconfiguratie moet conform deel B-1 van dit Hoofdstuk zijn, ongeacht de bij de andere wijzen van bedrijfsvoering verkregen resultaten.   
2.  De vastgestelde en gemerkte indelingslastlijnen moeten op het Veiligheidscertificaat voor Passagiersschepen worden geregistreerd, voorzien van aanwijzing P1 voor de situatie waarin het grootste aantal passagiers wordt vervoerd, en P2, P3, enz., voor de andere gebruiksconfiguraties. De situatie waarin het grootste aantal passagiers wordt vervoerd, moet worden aangehouden als de exploitatiewijze waarvoor de vereiste indelingsindex *R* de hoogste waarde moet hebben.   
3.  Het vrijboord dat met elk van deze lastlijnen overeenkomt, moet op dezelfde plaats en van dezelfde deklijn worden gemeten als het vrijboord dat volgens het van kracht zijnde Internationale Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen wordt vastgesteld.   
4.  Het vrijboord dat met elke goedgekeurde indelingslastlijn overeenkomt en de gebruiksconfiguratie waarvoor deze is goedgekeurd, moeten duidelijk op het Veiligheidscertificaat voor Passagiersschepen zijn vermeld.   
5.  In geen geval mag een indelingslastlijn zijn gemerkt boven de laagste lastlijn in zout water, bepaald door de sterkte van het schip of het van kracht zijnde Internationale Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen.   
6.  Ongeacht de locatie van de merken van de indelingslastlijnen mag een schip in geen geval zodanig geladen zijn, dat het uitwateringsmerk behorende bij seizoen en vaargebied, zoals bepaald krachtens het van kracht zijnde Internationale Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen, ondergedompeld is.   
7.  Een schip mag in geen geval zodanig geladen zijn, dat het merk van de indelingslastlijn dat behoort bij de desbetreffende reis en gebruiksconfiguratie in zout water ondergedompeld is.

Bovendien moeten instructieboekjes met deze gegevens ter beschikking van de officieren van het schip worden gesteld. <sup> 11)  Zie de richtlijnen voor schadebeheersingsplannen (MSC/Circ.919).  </sup>   
2.  Waterdichte deuren op passagiersschepen die tijdens de vaart geopend mogen blijven, moeten duidelijk in de stabiliteitsgegevens van het schip worden vermeld.   
3.  Als algemene voorzorgsmaatregel dient er een overzicht aanwezig te zijn van voorzieningen, omstandigheden en handelwijzen die door de Administratie noodzakelijk worden geacht voor het handhaven van de waterdichtheid bij normale uitvoering van de dienst aan boord.   
4.  Als bijzondere voorzorgsmaatregel dient er een overzicht aanwezig te zijn van factoren (zoals het sluiten, veiligheid van de lading, klinken van waarschuwingssignalen, enz.) die door de Administratie van wezenlijk belang worden geacht voor het behoud van het schip, de passagiers en de bemanning.   
5.  Bij schepen waarop de lekstabiliteitsvereisten van deel B-1 van toepassing zijn, moet de kapitein met de lekstabiliteitsgegevens de overlevingskansen van het schip eenvoudig en gemakkelijk kunnen beoordelen bij alle schadescenario’s waarbij een afdeling of groep van afdelingen betrokken is. <sup> 12)  Zie de door de Organisatie op te stellen richtlijnen.  </sup>   

### Voorschrift  20  

####Belading van passagiersschepen

1.  Na het laden van het schip en vóór het vertrek bepaalt de kapitein de trim en stabiliteit van het schip en stelt hij vast en tekent hij aan dat het schip voldoet aan de stabiliteitscriteria in de voorschriften ter zake. Het vaststellen van de stabiliteit van het schip geschiedt altijd door middel van berekening. De Administratie kan het gebruik van een elektronische beladings- en stabiliteitscalculator of een soortgelijk middel toestaan.   
2.  Voor het innemen van waterballast mogen in het algemeen geen brandstofolietanks worden gebruikt. Schepen waarop om praktische redenen niet voorkomen kan worden dat brandstofolietanks voor ballastwater worden gebruikt, moeten ten genoegen van de Administratie worden voorzien van een oliescheidingsinstallatie, of vervangende middelen, zoals voorzieningen voor het lossen aan de wal, die door de Administratie voor het afvoeren van oliehoudend ballastwater worden aanvaard.   
3.  Het bepaalde in dit voorschrift laat het bepaalde in het van kracht zijnde [Internationaal Verdrag ter voorkoming van verontreiniging door schepen](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/for/the/prevention/of/pollution/from/ships/1973/BWBV0003241/README.md) onverlet.   

### Voorschrift  21  

####Periodieke bediening en inspectie van waterdichte deuren, enz., op passagiersschepen

1.  Wekelijks moeten oefeningen plaatsvinden met de bediening van waterdichte deuren, patrijspoorten, kleppen en sluitingsinrichtingen van spuipijpen, as- en afvalstortkokers. Op schepen waarvan de reis langer dan één week duurt, moet een volledige oefening plaatsvinden voordat het schip de haven verlaat en de volgende oefeningen ten minste éénmaal per week gedurende de reis.   
2.  Alle waterdichte deuren, zowel draaideuren als werktuiglijk bediende deuren in waterdichte schotten die op zee in gebruik zijn, moeten dagelijks worden bediend.   
3.  De waterdichte deuren en alle daarbij behorende bedienings- en aanwijsinrichtingen, alle kleppen waarvan afsluiting noodzakelijk is om een afdeling waterdicht te maken en alle kleppen die bediend moeten worden voor dwarsscheepse overvloei-inrichtingen in geval van beschadiging, moeten op zee periodiek en ten minste éénmaal per week worden geinspecteerd.   
4.  Alle volgens dit voorschrift vereiste oefeningen en inspecties moeten in het logboek worden geregistreerd met duidelijke vermelding van elk vastgesteld gebrek.   

### Voorschrift  22  

####Voorkoming en beheersing van het binnendringen van water, enz.

1.  Alle waterdichte deuren moeten gesloten blijven tijdens de vaart, tenzij zij gedurende de vaart mogen worden geopend zoals bepaald in de paragrafen 3 en 4. Waterdichte deuren met een breedte van meer dan 1,2 m, in machineruimten toegelaten krachtens voorschrift 13.10, mogen slechts onder de in dat voorschrift omschreven omstandigheden worden geopend. Elke deur die in overeenstemming met deze paragraaf wordt geopend, moet onmiddellijk kunnen worden gesloten.   
2.  Onder het schottendek aangebrachte waterdichte deuren met een maximum openingsbreedte van meer dan 1,2 m, moeten gesloten blijven wanneer het schip op zee is, behalve indien strikt noodzakelijk, gedurende beperkte perioden vastgesteld door de Administratie.   
3.  Een waterdichte deur mag tijdens de vaart worden geopend om passagiers of bemanningsleden door te laten, of indien werkzaamheden in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van de deur het openen noodzakelijk maken. De deur moet onmiddellijk worden gesloten zodra men is gepasseerd of zodra de werkzaamheden die tot het openen noodzaakten, zijn voltooid.   
4.  Bepaalde waterdichte deuren mogen tijdens de vaart geopend blijven, doch slechts indien zulks strikt noodzakelijk wordt geacht; dat wil zeggen: indien is vastgesteld dat zulks van wezenlijk belang is voor de veilige en doeltreffende bediening van de machines van het schip of om de passagiers normaliter onbeperkt toegang te verlenen tot de voor passagiers toegankelijke ruimten. De vaststelling geschiedt door de Administratie na zorgvuldige afweging van de gevolgen voor de bedrijfsvoering en de veiligheid van het schip. Een waterdichte deur die aldus open mag blijven, moet duidelijk worden aangegeven in de stabiliteitsgegevens van het schip en altijd onmiddellijk kunnen worden gesloten.   
5.  Wegneembare platen in schotten moeten altijd zijn aangebracht voordat het schip de haven verlaat en mogen tijdens de vaart niet worden verwijderd, behalve wanneer dit, naar het oordeel van de kapitein, dringend noodzakelijk is. Bij het opnieuw aanbrengen van platen moeten de nodige voorzorgen worden genomen die de waterdichte sluiting verzekeren. Werktuiglijk bediende waterdichte schuifdeuren die in overeenstemming met voorschrift 13.10 in machineruimten zijn toegestaan, moeten worden gesloten voordat het schip de haven verlaat en tijdens de vaart gesloten blijven, behalve wanneer opening, naar het oordeel van de kapitein, dringend noodzakelijk is.   
6.  Waterdichte deuren aangebracht in waterdichte schotten die tussendekslaadruimten van elkaar scheiden in overeenstemming met voorschrift 13.9.1, moeten worden gesloten voordat de reis begint en tijdens de vaart gesloten blijven; de tijdstippen waarop deze deuren in de haven worden geopend en voordat het schip de haven verlaat worden gesloten, moeten in het logboek worden vermeld.   
7.  Onder het schottendek aangebrachte toegangs-, laad- en brandstofpoorten moeten voordat het schip de haven verlaat afdoende gesloten en waterdicht vergrendeld worden en tijdens de vaart gesloten blijven.   
8.  De volgende deuren, gelegen boven het schottendek, moeten gesloten en vergrendeld zijn voordat het schip een reis begint en moeten gesloten en vergrendeld blijven totdat het schip zich op zijn volgende aanlegplaats bevindt: 

.1 laaddeuren in de huid of in de buitenschotten van gesloten bovenbouwen;  

.2 boegkleppen op de in paragraaf 8.1 genoemde plaatsen;  

.3 laaddeuren in het aanvaringsschot; en  

.4 opritten die deel uitmaken van een andere sluiting dan omschreven in de paragrafen 8.1 tot en met 8.3.     
9.  Wanneer een deur niet kan worden geopend of gesloten terwijl het schip op de aanlegplaats ligt, mag deze geopend worden of blijven terwijl het schip de aanlegplaats nadert of zich daarvan verwijdert, mits niet verder van de aanlegplaats dan nodig is om de deur onmiddellijk te bedienen. De binnenste boegdeur moet in elk geval gesloten blijven.   
10.  Niettegenstaande de vereisten van de paragrafen 8.1 en 8.4 kan de Administratie toestaan dat bepaalde deuren naar goeddunken van de kapitein kunnen worden geopend, voor zover noodzakelijk voor de bedrijfsvoering van het schip of het inschepen en ontschepen van passagiers, wanneer het schip op een veilige ankerplaats ligt en mits de veiligheid van het schip niet in gevaar wordt gebracht.   
11.  De kapitein dient erop toe te zien dat een doeltreffend toezicht- en meldingssysteem voor het sluiten en openen van de in paragraaf 8 genoemde deuren wordt gebruikt.   
12.  De kapitein dient erop toe te zien dat voordat het schip een reis begint in het logboek het tijdstip wordt aangetekend waarop de deuren genoemd in paragraaf 13 voor het laatst zijn gesloten en het tijdstip waarop bepaalde deuren in overeenstemming met paragraaf 14 zijn geopend.   
13.  Draaideuren, afneembare platen, patrijspoorten, toegangs-, laad- en bunkerpoorten en andere openingen die op grond van deze voorschriften gedurende de vaart gesloten moeten blijven, moeten, voordat het schip de haven verlaat, worden gesloten. De tijdstippen van sluiten en openen (indien openen volgens deze voorschriften geoorloofd is) moeten in een door de Administratie aangewezen logboek worden aangetekend.   
14.  Indien op een tussendek de onderkant van de dagopening van een patrijspoort, bedoeld in voorschrift 15.3.2, lager is gelegen dan een lijn die evenwijdig loopt aan het schottendek op het scheepsboord en die haar laagste punt heeft op een hoogte van 1,4 meter, vermeerderd met 2,5% van de breedte van het schip boven het water wanneer het schip uit een haven vertrekt, moeten alle patrijspoorten op dat tussendek, vóór het schip de haven verlaat, waterdicht zijn gesloten en vastgezet en mogen zij niet worden geopend voordat het schip in de volgende haven is aangekomen. Bij toepassing van deze paragraaf mag, zo nodig, met de grotere diepgang in zoet water rekening worden gehouden. 

.1 Het tijdstip waarop dergelijke patrijspoorten in de haven geopend, alsmede het tijdstip waarop zij, vóór het schip een haven verlaat, vergrendeld worden, moeten in een door de Administratie voorgeschreven logboek worden aangetekend.  

.2 Voor een schip met een of meer patrijspoorten die zo gelegen zijn dat de vereisten van paragraaf 14 van toepassing zouden zijn, indien het was ingezonken tot de diepste indelingsdiepgang, kan de Administratie de grootste gemiddelde diepgang aangeven waarbij deze patrijspoorten met de onderkant van de dagopening blijven boven de lijn die evenwijdig loopt aan het schottendek op het scheepsboord en haar laagste punt heeft op een hoogte van 1,4 meter, vermeerderd met 2,5% van de breedte van het schip, boven de waterlijn die behoort bij de grootste gemiddelde diepgang en op welke diepgang het dus geoorloofd is uit een haven te vertrekken, zonder dat bedoelde poorten van te voren gesloten en vergrendeld zijn, en ze tijdens de reis naar de volgende haven onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de kapitein te openen. In de tropische vaargebieden, zoals omschreven in het van kracht zijnde [Internationale Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md), mag deze grootste diepgang met 0,3 meter worden vermeerderd.     
15.  Patrijspoorten en hun blinden die gedurende de vaart niet bereikbaar zijn, moeten, vóór het schip de haven verlaat, gesloten en geborgd zijn.   
16.  Indien lading in de in voorschrift 15.5.2 bedoelde ruimten wordt vervoerd, moeten de patrijspoorten en hun blinden waterdicht worden gesloten en vergrendeld vóór de lading is ingenomen en het sluiten en vastzetten moet in het door de Administratie aangewezen logboek worden aangetekend.   
17.  Wanneer afvalstortkokers etc., niet in gebruik zijn, moeten de krachtens voorschrift 15.10.2 vereiste deksels en kleppen gesloten en geborgd blijven.

### DEEL  C  

####- MACHINE-INSTALLATIES

(Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anderszins bepaald, is Deel C van toepassing op passagierschepen en vrachtschepen)  

### Voorschrift  26  

####Algemeen

1.  De werktuigen, ketels en overige drukvaten, alsmede bijbehorende pijpleidingsystemen en appendages moeten van een zodanig ontwerp en een zodanige constructie zijn, dat zij geschikt zijn voor het gebruik waarvoor zij zijn bestemd en dienen zodanig te zijn opgesteld en beveiligd dat hierdoor personen aan boord zo min mogelijk gevaar lopen, waarbij naar behoren aandacht wordt geschonken aan bewegende delen, hete oppervlakken en andere gevaarlijke zaken. Bij het ontwerp dient aandacht te worden geschonken aan het soort materiaal dat in de constructie wordt toegepast, aan het gebruik waarvoor de uitrusting is bedoeld, alsook aan de omstandigheden waaronder en de omgeving waarin deze aan boord zal moeten functioneren.   
2.  De Administratie dient in het bijzonder te letten op de betrouwbaarheid van enkelvoudig aanwezige onderdelen welke essentieel zijn voor de voortstuwing. De Administratie kan een aparte, aanvullende voortstuwingsmogelijkheid eisen, voldoende om het schip een snelheid te geven waarbij besturing mogelijk is, in het bijzonder in gevallen waarin het ongebruikelijke installaties betreft.   
3.  Er moeten middelen aanwezig zijn waarmede een normale werking van de voortstuwingswerktuigen gehandhaafd kan blijven of kan worden hersteld, ook indien een van de essentiële hulpwerktuigen uitvalt. Speciale aandacht dient te worden geschonken aan het uitvallen van: 

1. een generatorset die als elektrische hoofdkrachtbron dient;  

2. de stroomvormers en het stroomsysteem;  

3. het ketelvoedingwatersysteem;  

4. de brandstofsystemen voor ketels of motoren;  

5. het smeeroliesysteem met pompen en appendages;  

6. het koelwatersysteem met pompen en appendages;  

7. een condensaatpomp en middelen om het vacuüm in de condensors te handhaven;  

8. de mechanische luchtvoorziening voor de ketels;  

9. een luchtcompressor en luchtvat voor het aanzetten of voor het regelen;  

10. het hydraulische, pneumatische of elektrische systeem voor het regelen van hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen met inbegrip van verstelbare schroefsystemen.   De Administratie kan echter, met inachtneming van de algehele veiligheid, genoegen nemen met een gedeeltelijke vermindering van de voortstuwingscapaciteit ten opzichte van de normale werking.   
4.  Er dienen voorzieningen aanwezig te zijn, door middel waarvan de werktuiglijke installaties zonder hulp van buitenaf in bedrijf kan worden gesteld vanuit doodschip.   
5.  Alle ketels, delen van werktuigen, alle stoomsystemen, hydraulische, pneumatische en andere systemen, alsmede hun appendages die aan inwendige druk onderhevig zijn, dienen naar behoren te worden beproefd, ook onder druk, alvorens zij voor de eerste keer in gebruik worden gesteld.   
6.  Hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen en alle hulpwerktuigen die noodzakelijk zijn voor de voortstuwing en de veiligheid van het schip dienen, zoals zij in het schip zijn aangebracht, in staat te zijn te functioneren wanneer het schip recht ligt en bij een slagzij van 15 graden naar beide zijden onder statische omstandigheden en van 22½ graden naar beide zijden onder dynamische omstandigheden (rollen), terwijl het te gelijker tijd een dynamische stampbeweging van 7,5 graden over boeg of achtersteven maakt. De Administratie kan afwijkingen van deze hoeken toestaan afhankelijk van het type schip, afmeting en bedrijfsomstandigheden van het schip.   
7.  Er dienen voorzieningen te worden getroffen om het schoonhouden, het nazien en het onderhoud van hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen en hulpwerktuigen, met inbegrip van ketels en drukvaten zo eenvoudig mogelijk te maken.   
8.  Speciale aandacht dient te worden gegeven aan het ontwerp, de constructie en installatie van voortstuwingssystemen opdat trillingen hierin tijdens normaal gebruik geen bovenmatige spanningen veroorzaken.   
9.  Niet-metalen expansieverbindingsstukken in leidingsystemen, indien door het scheepsboord gevoerd waarbij zowel de doorvoering als het niet-metalen expansieverbindingsstuk zich onder de hoogst gelegen lastlijn bevinden, moeten worden geïnspecteerd in het kader van de in voorschrift I/10(a) voorgeschreven onderzoeken en zonodig worden vervangen, of zo vaak worden vervangen als aanbevolen door de fabrikant.   
10.  Bedienings- en onderhoudsinstructies en technische tekeningen van de werktuigkundige installaties en uitrusting van het schip die essentieel zijn voor de veilige bedrijfsvoering aan boord moeten zijn opgesteld in een taal die begrijpelijk is voor de officieren en bemanningsleden die deze informatie moeten begrijpen voor de uitvoering van hun taken.   
11.  De plaatsing en inrichting van luchtpijpen voor de brandstofoliedag-, brandstofoliebezink- en smeerolietanks moeten zodanig zijn dat indien een luchtpijp breekt, niet direct het risico ontstaat dat overkomend zeewater of regenwater binnendringen. Twee brandstofoliedagtanks voor elk type brandstof dat aan boord wordt gebruikt voor de voortstuwing en vitale systemen of gelijkwaardige inrichtingen moeten aanwezig zijn op elk nieuw schip met een capaciteit om de voortstuwingsinstallatie bij maximum continu vermogen en een normale operationele belasting van de elektrische installatie tijdens zeebedrijf tenminste acht uur in bedrijf te houden. Deze paragraaf is alleen van toepassing op schepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 1998.   

### Voorschrift  27  

####Werktuigen

1.  Werktuigen die te snel kunnen draaien, dienen van zodanige beveiligingsmiddelen voorzien te zijn dat de veilige snelheid niet wordt overschreden.   
2.  Indien hoofd- of hulpwerktuigen, waaronder tevens begrepen drukvaten of onderdelen van deze werktuigen aan inwendige druk onderhevig zijn en aan gevaarlijke overdruk kunnen worden blootgesteld, dienen er, waar mogelijk, voorzieningen aanwezig te zijn die tegen zulk een te hoge druk bescherming bieden.   
3.  Alle tandwieloverbrengingen en elke as en koppeling gebruikt voor het overbrengen van vermogen naar werktuigen die van essentieel belang zijn voor de voortstuwing en veiligheid van het schip of voor de veiligheid van personen aan boord, dienen zodanig te zijn ontworpen en vervaardigd dat zij bestand zijn tegen de hoogste spanningen waaraan zij onder alle bedrijfsomstandigheden kunnen worden blootgesteld en er dient naar behoren te worden gelet op het soort werktuigen waardoor zij worden aangedreven of waarvan zij deel uitmaken.   
4.  Verbrandingsmotoren met een cilinderdiameter van 200 mm of meer of een krukkastvolume van 0,6 m <sup>3</sup> of meer, dienen te zijn voorzien van krukkastexplosiekleppen: deze moeten van een geschikt type zijn en voldoende doortocht hebben. De ontlastkleppen dienen zodanig te zijn aangebracht of met voorzieningen te zijn uitgerust dat bij het in werking treden de uitstroming wordt geleid op een wijze waarop personeelsleden zo min mogelijk kans lopen op letsel.   
5.  Turbine-installaties voor de hoofdvoortstuwingen, indien van toepassing, verbrandingsmotoren voor de hoofdvoortstuwing en hulpwerktuigen dienen te zijn uitgerust met automatische voorzieningen om deze uit te schakelen in geval van gebreken, zoals het stoppen van de smeerolietoevoer, die spoedig zouden kunnen leiden tot een totaal uitvallen, tot ernstige schade of tot explosie. De Administratie kan voorzieningen toestaan die de automatische uitschakeling weer ongedaan maken.   

### Voorschrift  28  

####Middelen voor achteruit varen

1.  Er dient voldoende vermogen om achteruit te kunnen varen aanwezig te zijn, ten einde een goede besturing van het schip onder normale bedrijfsomstandigheden te verzekeren.   
2.  Er moet worden aangetoond en geregistreerd dat de machineinstallatie in staat is de richting van de stuwdruk van de schroef binnen aanvaardbare tijd om te keren en hiermede het schip binnen een redelijke afstand vanuit de maximale dienstsnelheid vooruit tot stilstand te brengen.   
3.  Een overzicht van de stoptijden, en daarmede verband houdende koersen en afstanden van het schip zoals tijdens proefvaarten vastgesteld, te zamen met de resultaten van de proefnemingen om bij schepen met meerdere schroeven de manoeuvreer- en stuureigenschappen bij het uitvallen van één of meer schroeven vast te stellen, dient aan boord aanwezig te zijn ten behoeve van de kapitein of ander aangewezen personeel. <sup> *)  Verwezen wordt naar de „Aanbeveling inzake informatie die moet zijn opgenomen in het manoeuvreerboekje zoals aangenomen in IMCO-ResolutieA. 209(VII)”.  </sup>   
4.  Indien een schip is uitgerust met aanvullende voorzieningen om te manoeuvreren of te stoppen, dient de doeltreffendheid hiervan te zijn aangetoond en vastgesteld als bedoeld in de paragrafen 2 en 3.   

### Voorschrift  29  

####Stuurinrichting

1.  Elk schip moet, indien niet uitdrukkelijk anders voorgeschreven, zijn uitgerust met een hoofdstuurinrichting en een hulpstuurinrichting, zulks ten genoegen van de Administratie. De hoofdstuurinrichting en de hulpstuurinrichting dienen zodanig te zijn uitgevoerd dat een storing in één van beide inrichtingen de andere inrichting niet buiten werking stelt.   
2.1.  Alle onderdelen van de stuurinrichting en de roerkoning dienen van een deugdelijke en betrouwbare constructie te zijn, die voldoet aan de eisen van de Administratie. Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de deugdelijkheid van alle belangrijke onderdelen die niet in duplo aanwezig zijn.. Zodanige onderdelen dienen, waar nodig te zijn voorzien van antifrictie-lagers zoals kogellagers, rollenlagers of lagerbussen van lager-materiaal, die hetzij voortdurend dienen te worden gesmeerd, hetzij moeten zijn voorzien van aansluitingen om ze te smeren.   
2.2.  De ontwerpdruk voor de berekening van de afmetingen van pijpleidingen en andere onderdelen van de stuurinrichting die aan inwendige hydraulische druk onderhevig zijn, dient ten minste 1,25 maal de maximale werkdruk te zijn welke kan worden verwacht onder de bedrijfscondities, aangegeven in paragraaf 3.2, rekening houdend met de druk die in het lagedrukgedeelte van het systeem aanwezig kan zijn. Naar goeddunken van de Administratie moeten vermoeidheidscriteria worden gehanteerd bij het ontwerp van pijpleidingen en onderdelen, rekening houdende met de drukgolven als gevolg van dynamische belasting.   
2.3.  Er dienen ontlastkleppen te zijn aangebracht op elk gedeelte van het hydraulisch systeem dat kan worden afgesloten en waarin druk kan worden opgebouwd door de krachtbron of door uitwendige krachten. De afsteldruk van deze ontlastkleppen mag de ontwerpdruk niet overschrijden. De kleppen dienen voldoende ruim bemeten te zijn en zodanig te zijn aangebracht dat een ongewenste drukstijging boven de ontwerpdruk wordt voorkomen.   
3.  De hoofdstuurinrichting en de roerkoning moeten: 

1. voldoende sterk zijn gebouwd en in staat zijn om het schip bij maximum dienstsnelheid vooruit te kunnen besturen, hetgeen moet worden aangetoond;  

2 terwijl het schip de grootst toegestane diepgang in zeewater heeft en bij maximum dienstsnelheid vooruit, in staat zijn het roer van 35 graden uitslag aan één zijde naar 35 graden uitslag aan de andere zijde te doen bewegen. De tijdsduur nodig om het roer van 35 graden uitslag aan één zijde naar 30 graden uitslag aan de andere zijde te bewegen mag onder de bovengenoemde omstandigheden niet meer dan 28 seconden bedragen.  

3. werktuiglijk worden aangedreven indien dit nodig is om aan de eisen vervat in paragraaf 3.2 te voldoen en in elk geval wanneer de Administratie verlangt dat de roerkoning een diameter van meer dan 120 mm heeft ter plaatse van de helmstok, waarbij de versterking voor het varen in ijs buiten beschouwing wordt gelaten; en  

4. zodanig zijn ontworpen dat zij bij maximum snelheid achteruit niet zullen worden beschadigd. Dat aan deze eis ten aanzien van het ontwerp wordt voldaan, behoeft echter tijdens de proef vaarten niet bij maximum snelheid achteruit en maximumroeruitslag te worden bewezen.     
4.  De hulpstuurinrichting moet: 

1. voldoende sterk zijn gebouwd en in staat zijn het schip te besturen bij manoeuvreersnelheden en moet snel in werking kunnen worden gesteld in noodsituaties;  

2. in staat zijn het roer van 15 graden uitslag aan de ene zijde naar 15 graden uitslag aan de andere zijde te doen bewegen in niet meer dan 60 seconden, terwijl het schip de grootst toegestane diepgang in zeewater heeft en een vaart vooruit heeft gelijk aan de helft van de maximum dienstsnelheid vooruit, of 7 knopen, welke van de twee snelheden het grootste is; en  

3. werktuiglijk worden aangedreven, wanneer dit nodig is om aan de eisen vervat in paragraaf 4.2 te voldoen en in alle gevallen waarin de Administratie verlangt dat de roerkoning een diameter van meer dan 230 mm heeft ter plaatse van de helmstok, waarbij de versterking wegens het varen in ijs buiten beschouwing wordt gelaten.     
5.  De krachtwerktuigen van de hoofd- en de hulpstuurinrichting moeten: 

1. zodanig zijn uitgevoerd dat zij automatisch weer in bedrijf komen wanneer de krachtvoorziening na te zijn uitgevallen weer is hersteld;  

2. vanaf de brug in werking kunnen worden gesteld. Bij het uitvallen van een van de krachtwerktuigen van de stuurinrichting dient een hoorbaar en zichtbaar alarm gegeven te worden op de brug.     
6.1.  Indien de hoofdstuurinrichting twee of meer gelijke krachtwerktuigen omvat, behoeft geen hulpstuurinrichting te worden aangebracht, mits: 

1. bij passagiersschepen de hoofdstuurinrichting in staat is het roer te bewegen zoals vereist onder paragraaf 3.2 terwijl één van de krachtwerktuigen buiten bedrijf is;  

2. bij vrachtschepen de hoofdstuurinrichting in staat is het roer te bewegen zoals vereist onder paragraaf 3.2 terwijl alle krachtwerktuigen in bedrijf zijn;  

3. de hoofdstuurinrichting zodanig is uitgevoerd dat bij een enkelvoudig defect aan het pijpleidingsysteem of in een van de krachtwerktuigen, het defecte gedeelte zodanig buiten bedrijf kan worden gesteld dat de mogelijkheid tot sturen kan worden gehandhaafd of snel kan worden hersteld.     
6.2.  De Administratie kan tot 1 september 1986 de plaatsing toestaan van een stuurinrichting die haar betrouwbaarheid heeft bewezen, maar die niet voldoet aan de in paragraaf 6.1.3 voorgeschreven voorzieningen voor een hydraulisch systeem.   
6.3.  Stuurinrichtingen van andere typen dan het hydraulische dienen te voldoen aan eisen gelijkwaardig aan die welke zijn vervat in deze paragraaf, e.e.a. ten genoegen van de Administratie.   
7.1.  De besturing van de hoofdstuurinrichting moet mogelijk zijn zowel op de brug als in de stuurmachinekamer.   
7.2.  Indien de hoofdstuurinrichting is uitgevoerd overeenkomstig paragraaf 6 dienen twee onafhankelijke besturingssystemen aanwezig te zijn, welke beide vanaf de brug te bedienen zijn. Dit houdt niet in dat het stuurwiel of de stuurhefboom dubbel moeten worden uitgevoerd.

16.  Ieder tankschip en ieder chemicaliën- of gastankschip van 10.000 ton bruto en meer dient, behoudens het bepaalde in paragraaf 17, te voldoen aan het volgende: 

1. de hoofdstuurinrichting moet zo zijn ingericht dat, ingeval de stuurinrichting van het schip onklaar raakt ten gevolge van één enkel defect aan een onderdeel van de hoofdstuurinrichting, met uitzondering van de helmstok, het kwadrant of de onderdelen die voor hetzelfde doel zijn bestemd, of het vastlopen van één van de aandrijvingen van het roer, binnen 45 seconden na het uitvallen van één van de aandrijfsystemen weer over stuurvermogen kan worden beschikt.  

2. de hoofdstuurinrichting moet bestaan uit: 

2.1. twee onafhankelijke en gescheiden aandrijfsystemen die elk kunnen voldoen aan de eisen gesteld in paragraaf 3.2; of  

2.2. ten minste twee gelijke aandrijfsystemen die gelijktijdig onder normale omstandigheden in bedrijf kunnen zijn en te zamen kunnen voldoen aan de eisen gesteld in paragraaf 3.2. Om aan dit voorschrift te voldoen, dienen waar nodig hydraulische aandrijfsystemen onderling met elkaar in verbinding te worden gebracht. Het verlies van hydraulische vloeistof uit één systeem moet kunnen worden opgespoord en het defecte systeem moet automatisch buiten bedrijf kunnen worden gesteld, zodat het andere aandrijfsysteem of de andere aandrijfsystemen geheel bedrijfsklaar blijft (blijven).  

2.3. stuurinrichtingen welke niet hydraulisch zijn moeten aan gelijkwaardige normen voldoen.       
17.  Voor tankschepen, chemicaliën- of gastankschepen van 10.000 ton bruto of meer, doch minder dan 100.000 ton draagvermogen kunnen andere oplossingen dan die welke zijn vervat in paragraaf 16 worden toegestaan, waarbij het criterium van één enkel defect niet behoeft te worden gehanteerd voor de aandrijving of aandrijvingen van het roer, mits een gelijkwaardig veiligheidsniveau wordt bereikt en: 

1. na het onklaar raken van de stuurinrichting ten gevolge van een enkel defect in ongeacht welk deel van het pijpleidingsysteem of in de kracht werktuigen, het stuurvermogen binnen 45 seconden kan worden hersteld, en  

2. ingeval de stuurinrichting slechts bestaat uit een enkele roer-aandrijving, bij het ontwerp speciale aandacht wordt geschonken aan een spanningsanalyse, met inbegrip van vermoeidheids- en breukmechanica, voor zover van toepassing, aan de toegepaste materiaalsoorten, aan het aanbrengen van speciale afdichtingsvoorzieningen, alsmede aan beproeving en inspectie en doelmatig onderhoud. Met het oog op het voorgaande dient de Administratie Voorschriften op te stellen, waarbij inbegrepen de bepalingen van de „Richtlijnen voor het aanvaarden van enkelvoudige roeraandrijving voor tankschepen, chemicaliën- en gastankschepen van 10.000 ton bruto of meer, maar van minder dan 100.000 ton draagvermogen", zoals aangenomen door de Organisatie. <sup> *)  Verwezen wordt naar de Richtlijnen voor het aanvaarden van enkelvoudige roeraandrijving voor tankschepen, chemicaliën- of gastankschepen van 10.000 ton bruto of meer, maar van minder dan 100.000 ton draagvermogen, aangenomen door de Organisatie door middel van Resolutie A.467(XII).  </sup>     
18.  Voor een tankschip, een chemicaliën- of gastankschip van 10.000 ton bruto of meer doch minder dan 70.000 ton draagvermogen kan de Administratie tot 1 september 1986 een stuurinrichting aanvaarden die in de praktijk bewezen heeft zeer betrouwbaar te zijn doch niet voldoet aan het criterium van één enkel defect waaraan krachtens paragraaf 16 moet worden voldaan voor een hydraulisch systeem.   
19.  Elk tankschip, en elk chemicaliën- of gastankschip van 10.000 ton bruto of meer gebouwd vóór 1 september 1984 dient uiterlijk op 1 september 1986 te voldoen aan het volgende: 

1. de vereisten vervat in de paragrafen 7.1, 8.2, 8.4, 10, 11, 12.2, 12.3 en 13.2;

2.  Elke elektrische of elektro-hydraulische stuurinrichting bestaande uit één of meer krachtwerktuigen dient te zijn aangesloten op ten minste twee geheel afzonderlijke stroomkringen die rechtstreeks worden gevoed vanuit het hoofdschakelbord; één van deze stroomkringen mag echter via het noodschakelbord worden gevoed. Een elektrische of elektro-hydraulische hulpstuurinrichting behorende tot een elektrische of elektro-hydraulische hoofdstuurinrichting mag zijn aangesloten op één van de stroomkringen die de hoofdstuurinrichting voeden. De stroomkringen die een elektrische of elektro-hydraulische stuurinrichting voeden, moeten ruim genoeg zijn bemeten om alle motoren die hierop gelijktijdig kunnen worden aangesloten en gelijktijdig in bedrijf kunnen zijn, te voeden.   
3.  Deze stroomkringen en motoren dienen van een kortsluitbeveiliging en een overbelastingsalarm te zijn voorzien. Beveiliging tegen te hoge stroomsterkte, met inbegrip van de aanloopstroom, indien van toepassing, dient te beschermen tegen ten minste tweemaal de vollaststroomsterkte van de motor of de stroomkring die hierdoor wordt beveiligd en moet zodanig zijn uitgevoerd dat deze bij de gebruikelijke aanloopstroom niet aanspreekt. Indien driefasenvoeding wordt toegepast, dient er een alarm aanwezig te zijn dat het uitvallen van één van de voedingsfasen aangeeft. De in deze paragraaf vereiste alarmen dienen zowel hoorbaar als zichtbaar te zijn en zich te bevinden op een duidelijk waarneembare plaats in de hoofdmachinekamer of het controlestation van waaruit de hoofdmachine-installatie normaal wordt bediend, zulks zoals kan worden vereist ingevolge het bepaalde in Voorschrift 51.   
4.  Indien op een schip van minder dan 1600 ton de hulpstuurinrichting, die ingevolge Voorschrift 29.4.3 werktuiglijk moet worden aangedreven, niet elektrisch wordt aangedreven of wordt aangedreven door een elektromotor die in de eerste plaats voor andere doeleinden is bestemd, mag de hoofdstuurinrichting worden gevoed door slechts één stroomkring vanaf het hoofdschakelbord. In die gevallen waarin een elektro-motor die in de eerste plaats voor andere doeleinden is bedoeld, wordt toegepast om zulk een hulpstuurinrichting aan te drijven, kan de Administratie vrijstelling verlenen van de eisen gesteld in paragraaf 3, indien zij zich kan verenigen met de beveiligingsvoorzieningen en tot haar genoegen is voldaan aan de vereisten vervat in Voorschrift 29.5.1 en .2 en 29.7.3 ter zake van de hulpstuurinrichting.   

### Voorschrift  31  

####Bediening van de werktuiglijke installaties

1.  Hoofd- en hulpwerktuigen welke essentieel zijn voor de voortstuwing en de veiligheid van het schip moeten zijn voorzien van doeltreffende middelen voor het in werking stellen en bedienen ervan.

9. er dient een alarm aanwezig te zijn zowel op de brug als in de ruimte voor machines dat aangeeft wanneer de aanzetluchtdruk te laag is en dat aanspreekt op een niveau waarbij aanzetten van de hoofdmotor nog mogelijk is. Indien de afstandbediening van de voortstuwingswerktuigen is ingericht voor automatisch aanzetten, dient het aantal keren waarop automatische achtereenvolgende, vergeefse aanzetpogingen kunnen worden verricht beperkt te zijn en wel zodanig dat voldoende aanzetluchtdruk aanwezig blijft voor het lokaal aanzetten.     
3.  Indien de hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen met bijbehorende hulpwerktuigen, met inbegrip van de hoofdgeneratoren in meerdere of mindere mate zijn voorzien van automatische bediening of afstandbediening en voortdurend met de hand vanuit een controlekamer, kunnen worden gecontroleerd dienen de controlevoorzieningen zodanig te zijn ontworpen, uitgerust en geïnstalleerd dat de werking van de machine-installatie net zo veilig en doeltreffend is alsof deze installatie onder direct toezicht stond. Hiertoe gelden de Voorschriften 46 tot 50, voor zover van toepassing. Speciale aandacht dient te worden geschonken aan de beveiliging van zodanige ruimten tegen brand en vollopen.   
4.  In het algemeen dienen automatische systemen voor het aanzetten, alsmede bedienings- en controlesystemen te zijn voorzien van een mogelijkheid om deze systemen met de hand te bedienen. Defecten in enigerlei gedeelte van deze systemen mogen het gebruik van handbediening niet uitschakelen.

Alle bedieningssystemen die essentieel zijn voor de voortstuwing, bediening en veiligheid van het schip moeten onafhankelijk zijn of zodanig zijn ontworpen dat storing van een systeem niet leidt tot verstoring van het functioneren van een ander systeem.”;  

.2 in de tweede en derde regel van paragraaf 2 worden de woorden „en het de bedoeling is dat de ruimten voor machines zijn bemand” geschrapt;  

.3 de eerste zin van paragraaf 2.2 wordt vervangen door: „.2 De bediening moet, voor elke schroef apart, plaatsvinden door één bedieningssysteem, waarbij alle gerelateerde bedieningshandelingen, waar nodig met inbegrip van die van voorzieningen ter voorkoming van overbelasting van de voortstuwingsinstallatie, automatisch worden uitgevoerd.”;  

.4 paragraaf 2.4 wordt vervangen door: „.4 Manoeuvreerorders vanaf de brug moeten worden aangegeven in de controlekamer van de hoofdvoortstuwingsinstallatie en op de manoeuvreerstand;”  

.5 aan het einde van paragraaf 2.6 wordt de volgende nieuwe zin toegevoegd: „Het moet voorts mogelijk zijn de hulpwerktuigen die essentieel zijn voor de voortstuwing en veiligheid van het schip op of bij de desbetreffende werktuigen te bedienen”; en  

.6 de paragrafen 2.8, 2.8.1 en 2.8.2 worden vervangen door: „.8 Op de brug, in de controlekamer van de hoofdvoortstuwingsinstallatie en op de manoeuvreerstand moeten aanwijsinstrumenten aanwezig zijn voor: .8.1 schroeftoerental en -draairichting, in geval van vaste schroeven; en .8.2 schroeftoerental en spoed in geval van verstelbare schroeven;”.     
6.  Schepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2004 moeten als volgt voldoen aan de vereisten van de paragrafen 1 tot en met 5, als gewijzigd: 

.1 de volgende nieuwe subparagraaf .10 wordt toegevoegd aan paragraaf 2: 

„.10 automatiseringssystemen moeten zodanig worden ontworpen dat in geval van dreigende vertraging of uitschakeling van het voortstuwingssysteem de officier belast met de brugwacht tijdig wordt gewaarschuwd, zodat de navigatieomstandigheden in een noodsituatie kunnen worden beoordeeld. De systemen moeten in het bijzonder zorgen voor controle, monitoring, melding, alarmering en voor de uitvoering van veiligheidsmaatregelen om de voortstuwing te vertragen of te stoppen, terwijl de officier belast met de brugwacht de gelegenheid wordt geboden handmatig in te grijpen, behalve in gevallen waarin handmatig ingrijpen binnen korte tijd leidt tot volledige uitval van de motor en/of de voortstuwingsapparatuur, bijvoorbeeld in geval van te hoge snelheid.”       

### Voorschrift  32  

####Stoomketels en ketelvoedingwatersystemen

1.  Elke stoomketel en elke ongestookte stoomgenerator moet zijn voorzien van ten minste twee veiligheidskleppen van voldoende capaciteit. De Administratie kan echter, rekening houdend met de stoomproduktie of enig ander kenmerk van een stoomketel of ongestookte stoomgenerator, toestaan dat slechts één veiligheidsklep wordt aangebracht, mits zij ervan overtuigd is dat hiermede afdoende beveiliging tegen overdruk wordt geboden.   
2.  Elke met olie gestookte ketel die is ontworpen om zonder handbediening te werken, moet zijn voorzien van veiligheidsvoorzieningen die de olietoevoer afsluiten en een alarm geven bij te laag waterpeil, storing in de luchttoevoer en vlamdoving.

2.4 De inrichting van het lens- en ballastpompsysteem moet zodanig zijn, dat het uitgesloten is dat water van de zee en uit waterballastruimten naar laadruimten en machineruimten of uit de ene afdeling naar de andere kan stromen. Voorzorgsmaatregelen moeten worden genomen om te voorkomen dat een dieptetank, met aansluiting op de lens- en ballastleidingen, onbedoeld met zeewater volloopt wanneer zij lading bevat óf door een lenspomp wordt leeggepompt wanneer zij met waterballast is gevuld.  

2.5 Alle verdeelkasten en met de hand bediende afsluiters die in verbinding staan met de lensinrichtingen, moeten zodanig zijn opgesteld dat zij onder normale omstandigheden bereikbaar zijn.  

2.6 Er moeten voorzieningen zijn voor de waterafvoer van omsloten laadruimten gelegen op het schottendek van een passagiersschip en op het vrijboorddek van een vrachtschip, met dien verstande dat de Administratie kan toestaan dat voor het aanbrengen van middelen voor waterafvoer in een bepaalde afdeling van een schip of een type schepen vrijstelling wordt verleend, indien te haren genoegen wordt aangetoond dat de veiligheid van het schip, gezien de grootte of de indeling van die ruimten, daardoor niet wordt aangetast. 

2.6.1 Wanneer het vrijboord tot aan het schottendek, respectievelijk het vrijboorddek, zodanig is dat de dekrand wordt ondergedompeld wanneer het schip een helling heeft van meer dan 5 graden, moet het water worden afgevoerd door middel van een toereikend aantal spuipijpen van voldoende afmetingen die rechtstreeks overboord spuien; zij moeten zijn aangebracht in overeenstemming met de vereisten van voorschrift 15 in geval van een passagiersschip, en de voorschriften voor spuipijpen, inlaat- en afvoerpijpen van het van kracht zijnde [Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md) in geval van een vrachtschip.  

2.6.2 Wanneer het vrijboord zodanig is dat de rand van het schottendek, respectievelijk de rand van het vrijboorddek, wordt ondergedompeld wanneer het schip een helling heeft van 5 graden of minder, moet het water uit de omsloten laadruimten op het schottendek, respectievelijk het vrijboorddek, worden afgevoerd naar een geschikte ruimte of ruimten van voldoende capaciteit, die zijn voorzien van een waarschuwingsinstallatie voor een te hoog waterpeil, en zijn uitgerust met passende voorzieningen voor afvoer naar buitenboord. Daarnaast moet erop worden toegezien dat: 

.1 het aantal, de afmetingen en de plaatsing van de spuipijpen zodanig zijn dat er niet te veel vrij water wordt verzameld;  

.2 met de voorzieningen voor pompen die krachtens dit voorschrift zijn vereist voor passagiersschepen of vrachtschepen, naargelang hetgeen het geval is, rekening wordt gehouden met de eisen voor een vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie die water onder druk sproeit;  

.3 met benzine of andere gevaarlijke stoffen verontreinigd water niet wordt afgevoerd naar machineruimten of andere ruimten waarin ontstekingsbronnen aanwezig kunnen zijn; en  

.4 wanneer de omsloten laadruimte is beschermd door middel van een kooldioxidebrandblusinstallatie, de dekspuipijpen zijn uitgerust met middelen die het vrijkomen van verstikkende gassen voorkomen.    

2.6.3. Voorzieningen voor de waterafvoer in gesloten voertuig- en ro-ro-ruimten en ruimten van bijzondere aard moeten tevens voldoen aan de voorschriften II-2/20.6.1.4 en II-2/20.6.1.5.       
3.  Passagiersschepen 

3.1 De krachtens paragraaf 2.1 vereiste lenspompinrichting moet kunnen functioneren onder alle omstandigheden die in de praktijk na een calamiteit kunnen voorkomen, ongeacht of het schip recht ligt dan wel slagzij maakt. Voor dit doel zullen in het algemeen zuigpijpen naar de zijden van de afdelingen moeten worden aangebracht, met uitzondering van smalle afdelingen aan het scheepseinde waar één zuigpijp voldoende kan zijn. In afdelingen van bijzondere vorm kunnen extra zuigpijpen vereist worden. Maatregelen moeten worden getroffen, waardoor water in de afdeling de weg naar de zuigpijpen kan vinden. Waar de Administratie ervan overtuigd is dat in bepaalde afdelingen een lensinrichting ongewenst zou zijn, kan zij toestaan dat deze achterwege blijft, indien door berekeningen gemaakt in overeenstemming met de voorwaarden in de voorschriften 7 en 8 wordt aangetoond dat de overlevingskans van het schip daardoor niet wordt aangetast.  

3.2 Er moeten ten minste drie op de hoofdlensleiding aangesloten werktuiglijke lenspompen aanwezig zijn, van welke één door de voortstuwingswerktuigen mag worden gedreven. Wanneer het lenspompgetal 30 of groter is, moet een extra onafhankelijke werktuiglijke pomp aanwezig zijn. Het lenspompgetal moet als volgt worden berekend:   ![10000053583](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053583)
waarbij:  

| --- | --- | --- |
|:---|:---|:---|
|  *L*   | =  | de lengte van het schip (meters), als omschreven in voorschrift 2;  |
|  *M*   | =  | de inhoud van de machineruimte (kubieke meters), als omschreven in voorschrift 2, die zich onder het schottendek bevindt; vermeerderd met de inhoud van alle vaste brandstofoliebunkers die zich boven de binnenbodem en vóór of achter de machineruimte bevinden;  |
|  *P*   | =  | de volledige inhoud van de onder het schottendek gelegen ruimten voor passagiers en bemanning (kubieke meters), die zijn aangebracht ten behoeve van de accommodatie en het gebruik door passagiers en bemanning, met uitzondering van bagageruimten, bergplaatsen, provisieruimten en postkamers;  |
|  *V*   | =  | de gehele inhoud van het schip onder het schottendek (kubieke meters);  |
| *P* 1  | =  | *KN*,  |
| --- | --- | waarbij:  |
| --- | --- | *N* = het aantal passagiers dat het schip mag vervoeren; en  |
| --- | --- | *K* = 0,056L  |
| --- | --- | Wanneer de waarde van *KN* evenwel groter is dan de som van *P* en de gehele inhoud van de werkelijke passagiersruimten boven het schottendek, moet voor *P*<sub>1</sub> die som of de waarde van twee derde *KN* worden genomen, naargelang welke van de twee de grootste is.  |

3.3 Waar zulks praktisch uitvoerbaar is, moeten werktuiglijke lenspompen worden geplaatst in afzonderlijke waterdichte afdelingen die zodanig opgesteld of gelegen zijn dat zij niet door eenzelfde averij kunnen vollopen. Indien de hoofd- en hulpwerktuigen voor de voortstuwing en de ketels in twee of meer waterdichte afdelingen zijn geplaatst, moeten de pompen die als lenspomp kunnen dienen zoveel mogelijk over deze afdelingen worden verdeeld.  

3.4 Op een schip met een lengte van 91,5 meter of meer of met een lenspompgetal, berekend in overeenstemming met paragraaf 3.2, van 30 of groter, moet de inrichting zodanig zijn dat ten minste één werktuiglijke lenspomp beschikbaar blijft voor gebruik in alle omstandigheden waaronder het schip kan vollopen en waartegen het bestand moet zijn en wel als volgt: 

.1 één van de voorgeschreven lenspompen een noodpomp is van een type dat onder water op betrouwbare wijze werkt, en die wordt aangedreven door een zich boven het schottendek bevindende krachtbron; of  

.2 de lenspompen met hun krachtbronnen zijn zodanig over de lengte van het schip geplaatst dat ten minste één pomp in een onbeschadigde afdeling beschikbaar is.    

3.5 Met uitzondering van de aanvullende pompen die alleen voor de voor- of achterpiek zijn bestemd, moet elke voorgeschreven lenspomp zo zijn ingericht dat zij water kan pompen uit elke ruimte die ingevolge paragraaf 2.1 gelensd moet kunnen worden.  

3.6 Elke werktuiglijke lenspomp moet water door de voorgeschreven hoofdlensleiding kunnen pompen met een snelheid van niet minder dan 2 meter per seconde. Onafhankelijke werktuiglijke lenspompen die in machineruimten zijn opgesteld, moeten van rechtstreekse zuigpijpen op deze afdelingen zijn voorzien, doch niet meer dan twee dergelijke zuigpijpen zijn per afdeling vereist. Waar twee of meer dergelijke zuigpijpen aanwezig zijn, moet er ten minste één aan elke zijde van het schip zijn aangebracht. De Administratie kan voorschrijven dat onafhankelijke werktuiglijke lenspompen opgesteld in andere afdelingen eveneens van afzonderlijke rechtstreekse zuigpijpen worden voorzien. De rechtstreekse zuigaansluitingen moeten doelmatig zijn ingericht en de diameter van deze leidingen in een machineruimte mag niet kleiner zijn dan die van de hoofdlensleiding. 

3.7.1 Behalve de rechtstreekse zuigaansluiting of zuigaansluitingen, voorgeschreven in paragraaf 3.6, moet in de machineruimte een rechtstreekse zuigpijp van de hoofdcirculatiepomp geleid naar een voldoende laag gelegen punt in deze machineruimte en voorzien van een afsluiter met terugslagklep, zijn aangebracht. Op stoomschepen moet de diameter van deze zuigpijp ten minste tweederde van die van de zuigopening van de pomp zijn, terwijl aan boord van motorschepen deze diameter gelijk moet zijn aan die van de zuigopening van de pomp.  

3.7.2 Indien de hoofdcirculatiepomp naar het oordeel van de Administratie voor dit doel niet geschikt is, moet een rechtstreekse noodlenszuigpijp worden geleid van de grootste onafhankelijk werktuiglijk gedreven pomp die beschikbaar is naar een voldoende laag gelegen punt in de machineruimte; de diameter van deze zuigpijp moet gelijk zijn aan die van de zuigopening van de gebruikte pomp. De capaciteit van de aldus aangesloten pomp moet die van een voorgeschreven lenspomp overtreffen in een mate die door de Administratie voldoende wordt geacht.  

3.7.3 De klepstangen van de zee-inlaat en van de rechtstreekse zuigafsluiters moeten voldoende tot boven de machinekamervloer reiken.    

3.8 Alle lenszuigaansluitingen tot aan de aansluiting tot de pompen moeten gescheiden zijn van andere leidingen.  

3.9 De diameter *d* van de hoofdlensleiding moet zijn berekend volgens de hierna volgende formules. De werkelijke inwendige diameter van de hoofdlensleiding mag echter worden afgerond tot de dichtstbijzijnde standaardpijpdiameter die voor de Administratie aanvaardbaar is:   ![10000053584](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000053584)
waarbij: *d* de inwendige diameter van de hoofdlensleiding is (in mm); *L* en *B* de lengte en de breedte van het schip zijn (in meters) als omschreven in voorschrift 2; en *D* de holte van het schip naar de mal tot het schottendek is (in meters), mits, op een schip dat een omsloten, zich over de gehele lengte van het schip uitstrekkende laadruimte op het schottendek heeft, waaruit het water binnenboord wordt afgevoerd in overeenstemming met de vereisten van paragraaf 2.6.2, *D* wordt gemeten tot aan het volgende dek boven het schottendek. Wanneer de omsloten laadruimten een kleinere lengte bestrijken, is *D* de holte van het schip naar de mal tot het schottendek plus *lh/L*, waarbij *1* en *h* de totale lengte en hoogte van de omsloten laadruimten (in meters) zijn. De diameter van de lenspijpaftakkingen moet voldoen aan de door de Administratie gestelde eisen.  

3.10 Maatregelen moeten worden getroffen om te voorkomen dat een afdeling waarop een lenszuigpijp is aangesloten, volloopt ten gevolge van breken of beschadigen van deze pijp in een andere afdeling bij een aanvaring of bij aan de grond lopen. Hiertoe moet, wanneer een dergelijke pijp op enige plaats dichter dan een vijfde van de breedte van het schip (als omschreven in voorschrift 2 en gemeten loodrecht op hart schip ter hoogte van de diepste indelingslastlijn) van het scheepsboord of in een kokerkiel is gelegen, in de pijp binnen de afdeling welke het open eind van de pijp bevat, een terugslagklep zijn aangebracht.  

3.11 De verdeelkasten, kranen en afsluiters die in verbinding staan met de lensinrichting, moeten zodanig zijn opgesteld dat in geval van vollopen één van de lenspompen in elke afdeling kan pompen; bovendien mag schade aan een pomp of aan de aansluiting van een pomp aan de hoofdlensleiding, ontstaan buiten de lijn getrokken op een afstand van een vijfde van de breedte van het schip, de lensinrichting niet buiten werking stellen. Indien er slechts één pijpleidingstelsel door alle pompen wordt bediend, moeten de nodige kleppen die de lenszuigpijpen beheersen, boven het schottendek bediend kunnen worden. Wanneer behalve de hoofdlensinrichting ook een noodlensinrichting aanwezig is, moet deze onafhankelijk zijn van de hoofdinrichting en zo zijn ingericht dat een pomp op elke afdeling kan pompen wanneer een afdeling volloopt, als aangegeven in paragraaf 3.1; in dat geval behoeven alleen de kleppen noodzakelijk voor de bediening van de noodinrichting boven het schottendek te kunnen worden bediend.  

3.12 De bedieningsinrichtingen van alle kranen en kleppen, genoemd in paragraaf 3.11, die boven het schottendek kunnen worden bediend, moeten daar ter plaatse duidelijk zijn gemerkt en voorzien van een standaanwijzer die aangeeft of zij geopend of gesloten zijn.     
4.  Vrachtschepen Er moeten ten minste twee op de hoofdlensinrichting aangesloten, werktuiglijke lenspompen aanwezig zijn, van welke er één door de voortstuwingswerktuigen mag worden aangedreven. Indien de Administratie ervan overtuigd is dat de veiligheid van het schip niet wordt aangetast, kunnen lenspompinrichtingen in bepaalde afdelingen achterwege blijven.

####Bescherming tegen lawaai

<sup> *)  Verwezen wordt naar de Regels betreffende geluidshinder aan boord van schepen, zoals aangenomen door de Organisatie door middel van Resolutie A.468(XII).  </sup>  Er moeten maatregelen worden getroffen om machinelawaai in ruimten voor machines te beperken tot een aanvaardbaar, door de Administratie vastgesteld niveau. Indien dit lawaai niet voldoende kan worden beperkt, dienen de bronnen van het overmatige lawaai behoorlijk te worden geïsoleerd of afgezonderd óf er dient een aparte geluiddichte cabine te worden aangebracht, indien de ruimte bemand moet zijn. Voor personeel dat verplicht is deze ruimten te betreden, moeten oorbeschermers aanwezig zijn.  

### Voorschrift  37  

####Communicatie tussen brug en ruimte voor machines

1.  Er moeten ten minste twee onafhankelijk van elkaar functionerende mogelijkheden aanwezig zijn om orders door te geven van de brug naar de plaats in de ruimte voor machines of naar de controlekamer van waaruit de werktuigen normaal worden bediend. Eén van deze communicatiemiddelen dient een (machine)telegraaf te zijn, die een zichtbare aanwijzing geeft van de orders en van de beantwoording daarvan zowel in de ruimte voor machines als op de brug. Er dienen doelmatige mogelijkheden voor communicatie aanwezig te zijn met elke andere plaats van waaruit de werktuigen kunnen worden bediend.   
2.  Voor schepen gebouwd op of na 1 oktober 1994 gelden de volgende vereisten in plaats van de bepalingen van paragraaf 1: Er moeten ten minste twee onafhankelijk van elkaar functionerende mogelijkheden aanwezig zijn om orders door te geven van de brug naar de plaats in de ruimte voor machines of naar de controlekamer van waaruit de snelheid en de richting van de stuwdruk van de schroef normaal worden geregeld. Eén van deze communicatiemiddelen dient een (machinekamer)telegraaf te zijn, die een zichtbare aanwijzing geeft van de orders en van de beantwoording daarvan zowel in de ruimte voor machines als op de brug. Er dienen doelmatige mogelijkheden aanwezig te zijn voor communicatie vanaf de brug en de machinekamer met elke andere plaats van waaruit de snelheid of de richting van de stuwdruk van de schroef kan worden geregeld.   

### Voorschrift  38  

####Alarm voor werktuigkundigen

De elektrische noodkrachtbron, brandbluspompen, lenspompen - met uitzondering van lenspompen die alleen de ruimten gelegen vóór het aanvaringsschot bedienen -, elke vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie vereist krachtens Hoofdstuk II-2 en andere noodinstallaties die onmisbaar zijn voor de veiligheid van het schip, met uitzondering van ankerspillen, mogen niet voorlijk van het aanvaringsschot worden opgesteld.  

### DEEL  D  

####- ELEKTRISCHE INSTALLATIES

Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald, is Deel D van toepassing op passagierschepen en op vrachtschepen.  

### Voorschrift  40  

####Algemeen

1.  Elektrische installaties moeten zodanig zijn uitgevoerd dat: 

1. alle elektrische hulpdiensten nodig om de normale bedrijfs- en leefomstandigheden te handhaven, verzekerd zijn zonder dat behoeft te worden teruggevallen op de elektrische noodkrachtbron;  

2. elektrische diensten welke essentieel zijn voorde veiligheid, onder verschillende noodsituaties verzekerd zijn;  

3. de veiligheid van passagiers, bemanning en schip met betrekking tot gevaren die kunnen voortkomen uit de toepassing van elektriciteit is gewaarborgd.     
2.  De Administratie dient geëigende stappen te ondernemen om de uniformiteit in de uitvoering en toepassing van het bepaalde in dit Deel wat betreft elektrische installaties te verzekeren. <sup> *)  Hierbij wordt verwezen naar de Aanbeveling gepubliceerd door de Internationale Elektrotechnische Commissie en in het bijzonder naar Publikatie 92 - Elektrische installaties aan boord van schepen.  </sup>   

### Voorschrift  41  

####Elektrische hoofdkrachtbron en verlichtingsinstallaties

1.1.  Er moet een elektrische hoofdkrachtbron aanwezig zijn van voldoende vermogen om alle diensten genoemd in Voorschrift 40.1.1 te voeden. Deze hoofdkrachtbron moet ten minste bestaan uit twee generatoraggregaten.   
1.2.  Het vermogen van deze generatoraggregaten moet zodanig zijn dat, als een van de generatoraggregaten stopt, het nog mogelijk zal zijn de diensten die noodzakelijk zijn voor de normale bedrijfsvoering met betrekking tot de voortstuwing en de veiligheid te voeden. Eveneens moeten minimum omstandigheden van leefbaarheid zijn verzekerd die ten minste voldoende diensten voor koken, verwarming, proviand-koeIing, mechanische ventilatie, en voorzieningen voor drinkwater en water voor sanitaire doeleinden omvatten.   
1.3.  De elektrische hoofdkrachtbron van het schip moet zodanig zijn ingericht dat de diensten genoemd in Voorschrift 40.1.1 kunnen worden gehandhaafd ongeacht het toerental en de draairichting van het voortstuwingswerktuig of de schroefas.   
1.4.  Bovendien moeten de generatoraggregaten zodanig zijn uitgevoerd dat, indien één van de generatoren of de krachtbron hiervan buiten bedrijf is, de overige generatoraggregaten in staat zijn de elektriciteitsvoorziening te handhaven voor de diensten die nodig zijn voor het aanzetten van de voortstuwingsinstallatie vanuit een dood-schip-situatie. De elektrische noodkrachtbron mag worden gebruikt voor het aanzetten vanuit dood-schip-situatie, indien haar vermogen alleen of in combinatie met dat van een andere elektrische krachtbron, voldoende is om te gelijker tijd te voorzien in de elektrische energie voor de diensten vereist krachtens Voorschrift 42.2.1 tot 42.2.3 of 43.2.1 tot 43.2.4.   
1.5.  Indien transformatoren een essentieel onderdeel vormen van de volgens deze paragraaf vereiste stroomvoorziening, moet deze voorziening zodanig zijn ingericht dat dezelfde continuïteit van de stroomvoorziening als bepaald in deze paragraaf, verzekerd is.   
2.1.  Een elektrische hoofdverlichtingsinstallatie, die moet voorzien in de verlichting van alle delen van het schip die normaal toegankelijk zijn voor en worden gebruikt door passagiers of bemanning, moet door de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron worden gevoed.   
2.2.  De hoofdverlichtingsinstallatie moet zodanig zijn ingericht dat door brand of een ander ongeval in de ruimten waar de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron, de eventuele daarbij behorende transformatoren, het hoofdschakelbord en het hoofdverlichtingsschakelbord is opgesteld, niet de noodverlichtingsinstallatie als vereist in Voorschrift 42.2.1 en 42.2.2 of 43.2.1 en 43.2.2 en 43.2.3, buiten werking wordt gesteld.   
2.3.  De noodverlichtingsinstallatie moet zodanig zijn ingericht dat door brand of een ander ongeval in de ruimten waar de elektrische noodkrachtbron, de eventuele daarbij behorende transformatoren, het noodschakelbord en het noodverlichtingsschakelbord is opgesteld, niet de hoofdverlichtingsinstallatie als vereist in dit Voorschrift, buiten werking wordt gesteld.   
3.  Het hoofdschakelbord moet ten opzichte van één hoofdgeneratorstation zo zijn opgesteld dat, voorzover uitvoerbaar, de continuïteit van de normale stroomvoorziening alleen kan worden aangetast door brand of een ander ongeval in één ruimte. Een afgescheiden ruimte voor het hoofdschakelbord, zoals kan zijn voorzien in een machinecontrolekamer binnen de hoofdbegrenzing van de voortstuwingsruimte, wordt niet beschouwd als afscheiding tussen de schakelborden en de generatoren.   
4.  Waar het totaal geïnstalleerd elektrisch vermogen van de hoofdgeneratoraggregaten groter is dan 3 Megawatt, moet het hoofdrailsysteem zijn onderverdeeld in ten minste twee delen die normaal met elkaar moeten zijn verbonden door middel van wegneembare verbindingsstukken of andere goedgekeurde middelen; de aansluitingen van de generatoraggregaten en elke andere dubbel uitgevoerde uitrusting moeten, voor zover uitvoerbaar, gelijkelijk over de delen zijn verdeeld. Gelijkwaardige voorzieningen kunnen worden toegestaan ten genoegen van de Administratie.   
5.  Schepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 1998: 

.1 moeten in aanvulling op de paragrafen 1 tot en met 3, voldoen aan de volgende eisen: 

.1.1 indien de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron nodig is voor de voortstuwing en besturing van het schip, moet het systeem zodanig zijn geplaatst en ingericht dat de stroomvoorziening voor de uitrusting die nodig is voor de voortstuwing, besturing en de veiligheid van het schip wordt gehandhaafd of onmiddellijk hersteld, indien een van de in bedrijf zijnde generatoren uitvalt;  

.1.2 inrichtingen om de belasting te verlagen of gelijkwaardige voorzieningen moeten aanwezig zijn om de door dit voorschrift vereiste generatoren te beschermen tegen langdurige overbelasting;  

.1.3 waar de elektrische hoofdkrachtbron nodig is voor de voortstuwing van het schip, moet het hoofdrailsysteem zijn onderverdeeld in ten minste twee delen die normaal met elkaar moeten zijn verbonden door middel van twee scheidingsschakelaars of andere goedgekeurde middelen; de aansluitingen van de generatoraggregaten en andere dubbel uitgevoerde uitrustingen moeten, voor zover uitvoerbaar, gelijkelijk over de delen zijn verdeeld; en    

.2 hoeven niet te voldoen aan paragraaf 4.     
6.  Op passagiersschepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2010 moet in alle hutten aanvullende verlichting worden aangebracht om duidelijk de uitgang aan te duiden, zodat de gebruikers hun weg naar de deur kunnen vinden. Dergelijke verlichting, die op een noodstroomvoorziening mag zijn aangesloten of in elke hut een onafhankelijk werkende stroomvoorziening mag hebben, moet automatisch inschakelen wanneer de reguliere hutverlichting uitvalt, en gedurende ten minste 30 minuten aanblijven.

2. druklucht-startsystemen kunnen worden gevoed door de hoofd- of hulpluchtvaten via een hiertoe geschikte terugslagklep of door een noodluchtcompressor, die, indien elektrisch aangedreven, moet worden gevoed vanaf het noodschakelbord;  

3. al deze start-, oplaad- en energie-accumulatievoorzieningen dienen zich te bevinden in de noodgeneratorruimte; deze inrichtingen mogen voor geen ander doel worden gebruikt dan voor het functioneren van de noodgeneratorset. Dit betekent echter niet dat het opvullen van het luchtvat van het noodgeneratoraggregaat vanuit het hoofd- of hulpluchtsysteem via de in de noodgeneratorruimte aangebrachte terugslagklep niet is toegestaan.     
4.1.  Wanneer automatisch starten niet is vereist, kan worden toegestaan dat met de hand wordt gestart, zoals door middel van aanslingeren, of met behulp van vliegwielstarters, met de hand bediende hydraulische accumulatoren of kruitstartpatronen, indien kan worden aangetoond dat deze methoden doeltreffend werken.   
4.2.  Wanneer het met de hand starten niet uitvoerbaar is. moet worden voldaan aan de paragrafen 2 en 3, met dien verstande dat het aanzetten met de hand mag worden ingeleid.   

### Voorschrift  45  

####Voorzorgsmaatregelen tegen gevaar van aanraken van onder spanning staande delen, tegen brand en andere gevaren van elektrische oorsprong

(*De paragrafen 10 en 11 van dit voorschrift zijn van toepassing op schepen gebouwd op of na 1 januari 2007*)  

1.1.  Onbeschermde metalen delen van elektrische machines of uitrusting die niet zijn bestand om onder spanning te staan, maar die door een defect wel onder spanning zouden kunnen komen, dienen te zijn geaard, tenzij de machines of de uitrusting: 

1. worden gevoed met een spanning niet hoger dan 50V bij gelijkstroom of 50V tussen de geleiders bij wisselstroom; om deze spanning te bereiken, mogen geen spaartransformatoren worden gebruikt; of  

2. worden gevoed met een spanning niet hoger dan 250V, verkregen van beschermingstransformatoren, waarop slechts één verbruiksinstallatie is aangesloten; of  

3. zijn geconstrueerd volgens het beginsel van dubbele isolatie.     
1.2.  De Administratie kan aanvullende voorzorgsmaatregelen verlangen voor verplaatsbare elektrische uitrustingen die worden gebruikt in afgesloten of uitzonderlijk vochtige ruimten waar bijzondere gevaren kunnen bestaan als gevolg van geleidbaarheid.   
1.3.  Alle elektrische apparaten dienen zodanig te zijn geconstrueerd en zodanig te zijn aangebracht dat zij geen letsel veroorzaken bij normale behandeling of aanraking.   
2.  Hoofd- en noodschakelborden dienen zodanig te zijn geïnstalleerd dat het personeel in voorkomend geval zonder gevaar gemakkelijk toegang kan verkrijgen tot apparatuur en uitrusting. De zijkanten en de achterzijde en, waar nodig, de voorzijde van de schakelborden dienen doelmatig te zijn beschermd. Aan de voorzijde van zodanige schakelborden mogen geen onbeschermde, stroomvoerende delen zijn aangebracht, waarvan de spanning ten opzichte van de aarde hoger ligt dan een door de Administratie vast te stellen spanning. Waar nodig moeten aan de voor- en achterzijde van het schakelbord matten of roosters zijn aangebracht van niet geleidend materiaal.   
3.1.  Het verdeelsysteem waarbij het schip als terugleiding wordt gebruikt, mag voor geen enkel doel worden gebruikt op een tankschip, of voor krachtvoorziening, verwarming of verlichting op enig ander schip van 1600 ton bruto of meer.   
3.2.  De vereisten vervat in paragraaf 3.1 sluiten, onder door de Administratie aanvaarde voorwaarden, niet uit het gebruik van: 

1. kathodische bescherming met opgedrukte stroom;  

2. beperkte en plaatselijk geaarde systemen; of  

3. apparatuur voor controle van de isolatieweerstand, mits de circulatiestroom onder de meest ongunstige omstandigheden niet meer bedraagt dan 30mA.     
3.2.1.  Voor schepen gebouwd op of na 1 oktober 1994 sluit het vereiste van paragraaf 3.1 niet het gebruik uit van beperkte en plaatselijk geaarde systemen, mits mogelijk hieruit voortkomende stroom niet rechtstreeks door een van de gevaarlijke ruimten kan stromen.   
3.3.  Waar gebruik wordt gemaakt van het verdeelsysteem met het schip als terugleiding dienen alle eindgroepen, dat wil zeggen alle stroomkringen na de laatste beveiliging, dubbelpolig te zijn en moeten ten genoegen van de Administratie bijzondere voorzorgsmaatregelen worden getroffen.   
4.1.  Op een tankschip mogen geen geaarde verdeelsystemen worden gebruikt. De Administratie kan bij wijze van uitzondering toestaan dat op een tankschip in draaistroominstallaties met een lijnspanning van 3.000V of hoger, het sterpunt wordt geaard, mits mogelijk hieruit voortkomende stroom niet rechtstreeks door een van de gevaarlijke ruimten kan stromen.

.2.2 beperkte en plaatselijk geaarde systemen, mits mogelijk hieruit voortkomende stroom niet rechtstreeks door een van de gevaarlijke ruimten kan stromen; of  

.2.3 draaistroominstallaties met een lijnspanning van 1.000 V effectieve waarde of hoger, mits mogelijk hieruit voortkomende stroom niet rechtstreeks door een van de gevaarlijke ruimten kan stromen.       
5.1.  Behoudens toestemming van de Administratie in uitzonderlijke omstandigheden, dienen alle metalen mantels en afschermingen van kabels in elektrische zin continu en geaard te zijn.   
5.2.  Alle elektrische kabels en alle uitwendige bedrading naar apparatuur, dienen ten minste van een vlamvertragend type te zijn en dienen zodanig te zijn aangebracht dat hun oorspronkelijke vlamvertragende eigenschappen niet worden aangetast. Waar nodig voor bijzondere toepassingen kan de Administratie toestaan dat speciale soorten kabels worden gebruikt, zoals hoog-frequentkabels, die niet voldoen aan de hierboven vervatte vereisten.   
5.3.  Kabels en bedrading die dienen voor de essentiële krachtvoorziening of de noodkrachtvoorziening, voor verlichting, interne communicatie of signaalinrichtingen, dienen, voor zover mogelijk, niet door kombuizen, wasruimten, ruimten voor machines van categorie A en hun schachten, alsmede andere zeer brandgevaarlijke ruimten te worden gevoerd. Op ro-ro passagiersschepen moet de bekabeling voor noodalarmen en voor scheepsomproepsystemen die op of na 1 juli 1998 zijn geïnstalleerd, worden goedgekeurd door de Administratie, rekening houdend met de aanbevelingen van de Organisatie. Kabels die de brandbluspompen verbinden met het noodschakelbord dienen brandbestendig te zijn daar waar zij door sterk brandgevaarlijke ruimten lopen. Waar mogelijk dienen al dit soort kabels zodanig te zijn aangelegd dat zij niet onbruikbaar kunnen worden door eventuele verhitting van de schotten als gevolg van brand in een aangrenzende ruimte.   
5.4.  Wanneer kabels die in gevaarlijke ruimten zijn aangebracht gevaar van brand of ontploffing met zich brengen in geval van een elektrisch defect in zodanige ruimten, dienen, ten genoegen van de Administratie, bijzondere voorzorgen tegen zodanige risico's te zijn getroffen.   
5.5.  Kabels en bedrading dienen op zodanige wijze te zijn aangebracht en ondersteund dat schavielen of andere schade wordt vermeden.   
5.6.  Aansluitingen en aftakkingen van alle leidingen dienen zodanig te zijn vervaardigd dat de oorspronkelijke elektrische, mechanische, vlamvertragende en, waar nodig, brandwerende eigenschappen van de kabel behouden blijven.   
6.1.  Iedere afzonderlijke stroomkring dient te zijn beveiligd tegen kortsluiting en tegen overbelasting, behalve als toegestaan ingevolge Voorschrift 29 en 30, of wanneer de Administratie bij wijze van uitzondering anderszins toestaat.   
6.2.  De nominale waarde of de juiste afstelling van de beveiliging tegen overbelasting dient voor iedere stroomkring permanent te zijn aangegeven ter plaatse van de beveiligingsinrichting.   
7.  Verlichtingsarmaturen dienen zodanig te zijn geïnstalleerd dat geen temperatuurstijging kan ontstaan die de kabels en de bedrading zouden kunnen beschadigen en dat een te sterke verhitting van omringend materiaal wordt voorkomen.   
8.  Alle stroomkringen voor verlichting en krachtvoorziening in een bunker of een laadruimte dienen te zijn voorzien van een meerpolige schakelaar buiten die ruimte, om zodanige stroomkringen te kunnen verbreken.   
9.1.  Accumulatorenbatterijen moeten op een daartoe geschikte plaats zijn ondergebracht en de primair hiervoor gebruikte ruimten moeten doelmatig zijn ingericht en doeltreffend worden geventileerd.   
9.2.  In zodanige ruimten mogen zich geen elektrische of andere uitrustingen bevinden, die een ontstekingsbron kunnen vormen voor brandbare gassen behalve zoals toegestaan krachtens paragraaf 10.   
9.3.  Accumulatorenbatterijen mogen niet zijn opgesteld in nachtverblijven, behalve wanneer zij ten genoegen van de Administratie hermetisch zijn afgesloten.   
10.  Er mogen geen elektrische uitrustingen worden aangebracht in een ruimte waarin zich brandbare mengsels zouden kunnen verzamelen, bijvoorbeeld in afdelingen die in hoofdzaak zijn bestemd voor accumulatorbatterijen, in verfhutten, opslagruimten voor acetyleen of soortgelijke ruimten, tenzij ten genoegen van de Administratie is aangetoond dat zodanige uitrusting: 

.1 van essentieel belang is om bedrijfstechnische redenen;  

.2 van een type is dat het betrokken mengsel niet zal ontsteken;  

.3 geschikt is voor de betrokken ruimte; en  

.4 geschikt is verklaard voor veilig gebruik in de stoffen, dampen of gassen zoals die waarschijnlijk zullen voorkomen.     
11.  Op tankschepen mogen elektrische apparatuur, kabels en bedrading niet worden aangebracht op gevaarlijke plaatsen, tenzij deze voldoen aan normen die niet minder strikt zijn dan die welke voor de Organisatie aanvaardbaar zijn. Echter, op plaatsen waarvoor die normen niet gelden, mogen elektrische apparatuur, kabels en bedrading die niet voldoen aan de normen op gevaarlijke plaatsen worden aangebracht na een risicobeoordeling ten genoegen van de Administratie, teneinde te garanderen dat een gelijkwaardig niveau van veiligheid wordt gewaarborgd. <sup> 1)  Zie de door de Internationale Elektrotechnische Commissie gepubliceerde normen, IEC 60092-502:1999 „Elektrische installaties op schepen – Tankschepen”.  </sup>   
12.  Op een passagiersschip dienen de stroomverdelingssystemen zodanig te zijn aangebracht dat brand in een van de verticale hoofdsecties, zoals omschreven in Voorschrift II-2/3.9, niet de diensten die essentieel zijn voor de veiligheid in een andere zodanige sectie zal ontregelen. Aan deze eis zal zijn voldaan indien de hoofd- en noodvoedingleidingen die door een zodanige sectie lopen zowel verticaal, als horizontaal, zo ver mogelijk uit elkaar lopen.

####- AANVULLENDE VEREISTEN VOOR RUIMTEN VOOR MACHINES DIE PERIODIEK ZONDER TOEZICHT ZIJN

(Deel E is van toepassing op vrachtschepen, met dien verstande dat Voorschrift 54 betrekking heeft op passagiersschepen)  

### Voorschrift  46  

####Algemeen

1.  De aangebrachte voorzieningen dienen zodanig te zijn dat hiermede wordt verzekerd dat de veiligheid van het schip onder alle vaaromstandigheden, met inbegrip van het manoeuvreren, gelijk is aan die van een schip waarin de ruimten voor machines zijn bemand.   
2.  Ten genoegen van de Administratie moeten maatregelen zijn getroffen om te verzekeren dat de installatie betrouwbaar functioneert en moeten bevredigende regelingen zijn getroffen voor regelmatige inspecties en routine-controle, ten einde een voortdurende betrouwbare werking te waarborgen.   
3.  Ieder schip dient ten genoegen van de Administratie te zijn voorzien van documenten waaruit blijkt dat het geschikt is te functioneren met ruimten voor machines die periodiek zonder toezicht zijn.   

### Voorschrift  47  

####Brandpreventie

1.  Er dienen middelen aanwezig te zijn om een eventuele brand in een vroeg stadium te ontdekken en alarm te geven: 

1. in toevoerluchtkanalen en afvoergassenkanalen van ketels; en  

2. in spoelluchtkanalen van voortstuwingswerktuigen, tenzij de Administratie dit in een bepaald geval onnodig acht.     
2.  Verbrandingsmotoren die een vermogen van 2250 kW of meer hebben, of die cylinders met een diameter van meer dan 300 mm hebben, dienen te zijn voorzien van krukkast-olie-mistdetectors of van controleapparatuur voor de temperatuur van de motorlagers, dan wel gelijkwaardige inrichtingen.   

### Voorschrift  48  

####Bescherming tegen vollopen

1.  Lensputten in ruimten voor machines die periodiek zonder toezicht zijn, dienen op zodanige plaats te zijn aangebracht en op zodanige wijze te worden gecontroleerd dat de opeenhoping van vloeistoffen wordt ontdekt bij een normale trim- en hellingshoek en zij moeten groot genoeg zijn om gemakkelijk de normale lekkage te kunnen bevatten over de periode dat de desbetreffende ruimten zonder toezicht zijn.   
2.  Wanneer de lenspompen automatisch kunnen worden aangezet, dienen er middelen aanwezig te zijn om aan te geven wanneer er meer vloeistof binnenstroomt dan de pomp kan verwerken of wanneer de pomp vaker werkt dan onder normale omstandigheden te verwachten zou zijn. Voor deze gevallen kunnen kleinere lensputten worden toegestaan, om een redelijk tijdvak te overbruggen. Wanneer er automatisch geregelde lenspompen zijn aangebracht, dient bijzondere aandacht te worden geschonken aan de vereisten met betrekking tot voorkoming van verontreiniging door olie.   
3.  De bedieningsmiddelen van een afsluiter in een zeewaterinlaat, in een leiding onder de waterlijn of in een lens-injectorsysteem dienen zich op een zodanige plaats te bevinden dat er voldoende tijd is om deze in werking te stellen ingeval er in de desbetreffende ruimte water binnenstroomt, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met de tijd die vermoedelijk nodig is om zodanige bedieningsmiddelen te bereiken en in werking te stellen. Indien het niveau waar de ruimte zou kunnen vollopen wanneer het schip geheel is geladen dit vereist, dienen er voorzieningen te worden getroffen om de bedieningsmiddelen vanuit een boven dit niveau gelegen positie in werking te stellen.   

### Voorschrift  49  

####Bediening van de voortstuwingswerktuigen vanaf de brug

1.  Onder alle vaaromstandigheden, met inbegrip van het manoeuvreren, dienen de snelheid, de richting van de stuwdruk en, indien van toepassing, de spoed van de schroef volledig regelbaar te zijn vanaf de brug. 

1.1. Zulk een afstandbediening dient plaats te vinden door middel van één enkel bedieningssysteem voor iedere schroef apart, waarbij automatisch alle daarbij behorende voorzieningen, waar nodig met inbegrip van middelen ter voorkoming van overbelasting van de voortstuwingswerktuigen, in werking treden.  

1.2. Het hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuig moet zijn voorzien van een noodstopinrichting op de brug, die onafhankelijk is van de brugbediening.     
2.  Manoeuvreerorders vanaf de brug moeten, al naar gelang, worden aangegeven in de controlekamer voor de hoofdvoortstuwingsinstallatie, of op de manoeuvreerstand.   
3.  Afstandbediening van de voortstuwingswerktuigen mag slechts vanaf één plaats tegelijk mogelijk zijn; op die bedieningsplaatsen mogen met elkaar verbonden onderstations aanwezig zijn. Op elke bedieningsplaats moet kunnen worden afgelezen vanuit welke bedieningsplaats de voortstuwingswerktuigen worden bediend. Het overbrengen van de bediening tussen de brug en de voortstuwingsruimten dient uitsluitend in de hoofdvoortstuwingsruimte of in de hoofdcontrolekamer mogelijk te zijn. Het systeem dient voorzieningen te omvatten om te voorkomen dat de stuwkracht aanzienlijk verandert, wanneer de bediening van de ene plaats naar de andere wordt overgeschakeld.   
4.  Alle werktuigen die essentieel zijn voor de veilige werking van het schip moeten lokaal kunnen worden bediend, zelfs in geval van storing in enig deel van het automatische bedieningssysteem of het afstandbedieningssysteem.   
5.  Het automatische afstandbedieningssysteem dient zodanig te zijn ontworpen dat in geval van het uitvallen hiervan een alarm wordt gegeven. Tenzij de Administratie dit niet praktisch uitvoerbaar acht, moeten de ingestelde snelheid en de richting van de stuurdruk van de schroef worden gehandhaafd totdat de lokale bediening in bedrijf is.   
6.  Op de brug dienen aanwijsinstrumenten aanwezig te zijn voor: 

1. schroeftoerental en -draairichting, ingeval het vaste schroeven betreft; of  

2. de snelheid en de spoed van de schroef, ingeval het verstelbare schroeven betreft.     
7.  Het aantal achtereenvolgende automatische pogingen waarbij tevergeefs wordt getracht de voortstuwingswerktuigen in werking te stellen, dient beperkt te zijn zodat voldoende aanzetluchtdruk aanwezig blijft. Er dient een alarm aanwezig te zijn dat aangeeft wanneer de aanzetluchtdruk te laag is en dat aanspreekt op een druk waarbij het nog altijd mogelijk is de voortstuwingswerktuigen aan te zetten.   

### Voorschrift  50  

####Communicatie

Er dient een betrouwbare spreekverbinding aanwezig te zijn tussen hetzij de controlekamer voor de hoofdvoortstuwing hetzij de bedieningsplaats van de voortstuwingswerktuigen, en de brug en de verblijven van de werktuigkundigen.  

### Voorschrift  51  

####Alarmsysteem

1.  Er dient een alarmsysteem aanwezig te zijn dat ieder defect aangeeft waaraan aandacht moet worden geschonken; het dient: 

1. een hoorbaar alarm te kunnen produceren in de controlekamer voor de hoofdvoortstuwing of op de bedieningsplaats van de voortstuwingswerktuigen en iedere afzonderlijke alarmfunctie op een passende plaats zichtbaar aan te geven;  

2. te zijn aangesloten op de ruimten voor algemeen gebruik door de werktuigkundigen en door middel van een keuzeschakelaar met elke hut van een werktuigkundige, ten einde de verbinding met ten minste één van deze hutten te verzekeren. De Administratie kan gelijkwaardige voorzieningen toestaan;  

3. een hoorbaar en zichtbaar alarm op de brug te geven voor iedere situatie die maatregelen van de zijde van, dan wel aandacht van de officier van de wacht vereist;  

4. voor zover uitvoerbaar zodanig te zijn ontworpen dat een storing in het systeem door het systeem zelf wordt aangegeven; en  

5. het in Voorschrift 38 vereiste alarm voor werktuigkundigen in werking te stellen, indien er niet binnen een bepaalde tijd ter plaatse aandacht is geschonken aan een alarmfunctie.     
2.1.  Het alarmsysteem dient voortdurend bekrachtigd te worden en dient te beschikken over een automatische overschakeling op een reservekrachtvoorziening ingeval de normale krachtvoorziening uitvalt.   
2.2.  Het uitvallen van de normale krachtvoorziening voor het alarmsysteem dient te worden aangegeven door middel van een alarmsignaal.   
3.1.  Het alarmsysteem dient meer dan één defect tegelijk te kunnen aangeven en het accepteren van één alarm, mag niet verhinderen dat er nog een alarm wordt gegeven.   
3.2.  Wanneer er op de in paragraaf 1 bedoelde plaats een alarm wordt aanvaard, dient dit te worden aangeduid op de plaatsen waar het werd kenbaar gemaakt. Alarmsignalen dienen te blijven gehandhaafd totdat zij worden aanvaard en de zichtbare aanduidingen van individuele alarmsignalen dienen voort te duren totdat het defect is verholpen waarna het alarmsysteem automatisch weer in zijn normale bedrijfstoestand wordt gebracht.   

### Voorschrift  52  

####Beveiligingssystemen

Er dient een beveiligingssysteem aanwezig te zijn om te verzekeren dat bij een ernstige storing in de werking van de machine-installatie of van de ketels, die een onmiddellijk gevaar oplevert, automatisch dat deel van de installatie wordt gestopt en dat er alarm wordt gegeven. Het stoppen van de voortstuwingsinstallatie mag niet automatisch gebeuren, behalve in gevallen waarin ernstige schade zou kunnen optreden, waarin het systeem volledig onklaar zou kunnen geraken of waarin er kans is op ontploffing. Wanneer er voorzieningen zijn aangebracht om het stoppen van de hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen te overbruggen, dienen deze zodanig te zijn uitgevoerd dat een ongewild gebruik ervan niet mogelijk is. Wanneer de overbrugging in werking is gesteld, dient dit op zichtbare wijze te worden aangegeven.  

### Voorschrift  53  

####Bijzondere vereisten voor de machine-installaties, de ketels en de elektrische installaties

1.  De bijzondere vereisten voor de machine-installaties, de ketels en de elektrische installaties dienen ten genoegen van de Administratie te zijn en dienen ten minste de in dit Voorschrift vervatte vereisten te omvatten.   
2.  De elektrische hoofdkrachtbron dient aan de volgende voorwaarden te voldoen: 

2.1. Wanneer het elektrisch vermogen normaal kan worden geleverd door één generator, dienen geschikte inrichtingen aanwezig te zijn om de belasting te verlagen, ten einde te verzekeren dat de voeding van voorzieningen die zijn vereist voor de voortstuwing en de besturing, alsmede voor de veiligheid van het schip, in stand blijft. Ingeval de in bedrijf zijnde generator onklaar raakt, dienen passende voorzieningen te worden getroffen voor het automatisch aanzetten en het inschakelen op het hoofdschakelbord van een reservegenerator met voldoende vermogen om de voortstuwing en de besturing mogelijk te maken, alsmede de veiligheid van het schip te verzekeren, terwijl de essentiële hulpwerktuigen, met inbegrip van - waar noodzakelijk - de hiermede samenhangende functies, automatisch opnieuw in bedrijf worden gesteld. De Administratie kan voor een schip van minder dan 1.600 ton vrijstelling van deze eis verlenen, indien een en ander onuitvoerbaar wordt geacht.  

2.2. Indien het elektrisch vermogen normaliter wordt geleverd door meerdere generatoren die te gelijker tijd parallel werken, dienen voorzieningen te zijn getroffen, bijvoorbeeld door verlaging van de belasting, om te verzekeren dat, ingeval één van deze generatoren uitvalt, de overige in bedrijf blijven zonder dat zij overbelast raken, ten einde de voortstuwing en de besturing mogelijk te maken en de veiligheid van het schip te verzekeren.     
3.  Wanneer voor andere hulpwerktuigen, die essentieel zijn voor de voortstuwing, reserve-installaties zijn vereist, dienen automatische overschakelingsvoorzieningen te zijn aangebracht.   
4.  Automatisch bedienings- en alarmsysteem. 

4.1. Het bedieningssysteem dient zodanig te zijn dat de voorzieningen die nodig zijn voor de werking van de hoofdvoortstuwingsinstallatie en bijbehorende hulpwerktuigen, worden gewaarborgd door middel van de noodzakelijke automatische inrichtingen.  

4.2. Bij automatische overschakeling dient een alarm te worden gegeven.  

4.3. Er dient een alarmsysteem voor alle belangrijke drukken, temperaturen en vloeistofniveaus en andere essentiële parameters te zijn aangebracht, dat voldoet aan het bepaalde in Voorschrift 51.  

4.4. Er dient een centrale bedieningsplaats te zijn aangebracht, waar zich de noodzakelijke alarmborden bevinden waarop elk alarm wordt aangegeven.     
5.  Er dienen middelen te zijn aangebracht om de aanzetluchtdruk op het vereiste niveau te houden wanneer er voor de hoofdvoortstuwing gebruik wordt gemaakt van verbrandingsmotoren.   

### Voorschrift  54  

####Bijzondere overwegingen voor passagiersschepen

De Administratie dient bijzondere aandacht te schenken aan passagiersschepen, waar het de vraag betreft of de ruimten voor machines al dan niet periodiek zonder toezicht mogen zijn en, zo ja, of er dan aanvullende vereisten, naast die welke in deze Voorschriften zijn vervat, noodzakelijk zijn om te komen tot dezelfde mate van veiligheid als bij ruimten voor machines waarop normaal toezicht wordt uitgeoefend.

3.1 Alle schepen die reparaties, wijzigingen, veranderingen, alsmede de daarmee verband houdende aanpassingen van de uitrusting ondergaan, moeten ten minste blijven voldoen aan de voorschriften die voordien op die schepen van toepassing waren. Indien het hier gaat om schepen gebouwd vóór 1 juli 2012, moeten deze over het algemeen voldoen aan de voorschriften die voordien op die schepen van toepassing waren.  

3.2 Reparaties, veranderingen en wijzigingen waardoor de afmetingen van een schip of de ruimte van de passagiershutten veranderen, of waardoor de economische levensduur en daarmee verband houdende uitrusting wezenlijk worden uitgebreid, moeten voldoen aan de voorschriften voor schepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2012, voor zover de Administratie zulks redelijk en uitvoerbaar acht.    

4. Vrijstellingen 

4.1 De Administratie kan, wanneer zij van oordeel is dat de beschutte aard en de omstandigheden van de reis zodanig zijn dat toepassing van bepaalde vereisten van dit hoofdstuk redelijk noch noodzakelijk is, bepaalde schepen of klassen van schepen die bevoegd zijn de vlag van de desbetreffende staat te voeren, die in de loop van hun reis niet meer dan 20 zeemijl uit de kust van het dichtstbijzijnde land varen, vrijstellen van die vereisten.  

4.2 Wanneer passagiersschepen worden gebruikt op bijzondere reizen voor het vervoer van grote aantallen passagiers op deze reizen, zoals bij het pelgrimsvervoer, kan de Administratie, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het praktisch onuitvoerbaar is naleving van de vereisten van dit hoofdstuk op te leggen, dergelijke schepen vrijstellen van die vereisten, mits zij volledig voldoen aan de bepalingen van: 

.1 de voorschriften gehecht aan de Overeenkomst betreffende passagiersschepen gebezigd op bijzondere reizen, 1971; en  

.2 de voorschriften gehecht aan het Protocol betreffende de vereisten ten aanzien van passagiersruimten op passagiersschepen gebruikt op bijzondere reizen, 1973.      

5. Toepasselijke vereisten afhankelijk van het type schip Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald: 

.1 zijn vereisten die niet naar een specifiek type schip verwijzen op alle typen schepen van toepassing; en  

.2 zijn vereisten die naar „tankschepen” verwijzen van toepassing op tankschepen, behoudens de in onderstaande paragraaf 6 vermelde vereisten.    

6. Toepassing van de vereisten voor tankschepen 

6.1 De vereisten voor tankschepen in dit hoofdstuk zijn van toepassing op tankschepen die ruwe olie of petroleumproducten vervoeren met een vlampunt van ten hoogste 60 °C (closed-cup test), als vastgesteld door middel van een goedgekeurd vlampuntapparaat, en een dampspanning volgens Reid die lager is dan de atmosferische druk of andere vloeibare producten die een zelfde brandgevaar opleveren.  

6.2 Wanneer het vervoer van vloeibare lading anders dan de in paragraaf 6.1 bedoelde lading of vloeibaar gemaakte gassen die extra brandgevaar opleveren, wordt beoogd, zijn aanvullende veiligheidsmaatregelen vereist, met behoorlijke inachtneming van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk, als omschreven in voorschrift VII/8.1, de Code voor chemicaliën in bulk, de Internationale Code voor gastankschepen, als omschreven in voorschrift VII/11.1, en de Code voor gastankschepen, naar gelang van toepassing. 

6.2.1 Vloeibare lading met een vlampunt van minder dan 60 °C waarvoor een reguliere brandbestrijdingsinstallatie met schuim, die aan de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen voldoet, niet afdoende is, wordt aangemerkt als lading die in deze context een aanvullend brandgevaar oplevert. De volgende aanvullende maatregelen zijn vereist: 

.1 het schuim moet van het type alcoholbestendig zijn;  

.2 het type schuimconcentraten voor gebruik in chemicaliëntankschepen moet ten genoegen van de Administratie zijn, met in achtneming van de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen; en  

.3 de capaciteit en het debiet van de schuimblusinstallatie moeten in overeenstemming zijn met hoofdstuk 11 van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk, met dien verstande dat op basis van werkingsbeproevingen lagere debieten mogen worden aanvaard. Ten aanzien van tankschepen met inert-gasinstallaties mag een lagere hoeveelheid schuimconcentraat voldoende voor 20 minuten schuimtoevoer worden toegestaan.    

6.2.2 Voor de toepassing van dit voorschrift wordt een vloeibare lading met een dampspanning van meer dan 1,013 bar absolute druk bij 37,8 °C aangemerkt als lading die een extra brandgevaar oplevert. Schepen die dergelijke stoffen vervoeren moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 15.14 van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk. Wanneer schepen in beperkte gebieden en binnen beperkte tijden varen, kan de betrokken Administratie ontheffing verlenen van de vereisten voor koelsystemen in overeenstemming met paragraaf 15.14.3 van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk.    

6.3 Vloeibare lading met een vlampunt van hoger dan 60 °C, anders dan olieproducten of vloeibare lading waarop de vereisten van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk van toepassing zijn, worden geacht een gering brandgevaar op te leveren, waarvoor geen beveiliging in de vorm van een vast aangebrachte schuimblusinstallatie vereist is.  

6.4 Tankschepen die petroleumproducten vervoeren met een vlampunt hoger dan 60 °C (closed-cup test), vastgesteld door middel van een goedgekeurd vlampuntapparaat, moeten voldoen aan de vereisten vervat in de voorschriften 10.2.1.4.4 en 10.10.2.3 en aan de vereisten voor vrachtschepen anders dan tankschepen, behoudens dat zij, in plaats van met de vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie als vereist in voorschrift 10.7, moeten zijn uitgerust met een vast aangebrachte dekschuiminstallatie die moet voldoen aan de vereisten van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen.  

6.5 Combination carriers gebouwd vóór, op of na 1 juli 2002 mogen geen andere lading dan olie vervoeren, tenzij alle laadruimten olie- en gasvrij zijn gemaakt of tenzij de in elk geval getroffen voorzieningen door de Administratie zijn goedgekeurd, met inachtneming van de door de organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen.  

6.6 Chemicaliëntankschepen en gastankschepen moeten voldoen aan de vereisten voor tankschepen, behoudens wanneer ten genoegen van de Administratie voor vervangende en aanvullende voorzieningen wordt gezorgd, met behoorlijke inachtneming van de Internationale Code voor chemicaliën in bulk en de Internationale Code voor gastankschepen, naar gelang van toepassing.  

6.7 Op alle tankschepen gebouwd vóór 1 juli 2002 moeten op de datum van de eerste geplande droogzetting in een dok na 1 juli 2002, doch uiterlijk op 1 juli 2005, de vereiste voorzieningen van de voorschriften 4.5.10.1.1 en 4.5.10.1.4, alsmede een systeem voor continue bewaking van de concentratie van koolwaterstofgassen worden geïnstalleerd. Bemonsteringspunten of detectorkoppen moeten op geschikte plaatsen worden aangebracht zodat mogelijk gevaarlijke lekkages vlug worden gedetecteerd. Wanneer de concentratie koolwaterstofgassen een van tevoren vastgesteld niveau bereikt, dat niet hoger mag zijn dan 10% van de onderste ontvlammingsgrens, moet in de pompkamer en ladingcontrolekamer automatisch een doorlopend hoorbaar en zichtbaar alarmsignaal afgaan om het personeel voor mogelijk gevaar te waarschuwen. Bestaande reeds geïnstalleerde bewakingssystemen met een van tevoren ingesteld niveau van ten hoogste 30% van de onderste ontvlammingsgrens kunnen evenwel worden geaccepteerd.

### DEEL  B  

####VOORKOMING VAN BRAND EN EXPLOSIE

### Voorschrift  4  

####Kans op ontsteking

1. Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is de ontbranding van brandbare stoffen of ontvlambare vloeistoffen te voorkomen. Hiertoe moet aan de volgende functionele vereisten worden voldaan: 

.1 er moet worden gezorgd voor middelen voor het controleren op lekkende ontvlambare vloeistoffen;  

.2 er moet worden gezorgd voor middelen om de accumulatie van ontvlambare dampen te beperken;  

.3 de ontbrandingscapaciteit van brandbare materialen moet worden beperkt;

.5 ontstekingsbronnen moeten worden gescheiden van brandbare materialen en ontvlambare vloeistoffen; en  

.6 de atmosfeer in ladingtanks moet buiten het ontploffingsbereik worden gehouden.    

2. Inrichtingen voor brandstofolie, smeerolie en andere ontvlambare oliën 

2.1 Beperkingen in het gebruik van olie als brandstof De volgende beperkingen zijn van toepassing op het gebruik van olie als brandstof: 

.1 behoudens waar elders in deze paragraaf toegestaan, mag geen brandstofolie worden gebruikt met een vlampunt dat lager is dan 60 °C;  

.2 voor het gebruik in noodgeneratoren mag brandstofolie worden gebruikt met een vlampunt dat niet lager is dan 43 °C;  

.3 het gebruik van brandstofolie met een vlampunt dat lager is dan 60 °C maar niet lager dan 43 °C kan worden toegestaan (bijv. voor toevoer naar de noodmotoren van de brandbluspomp en de hulpmachines die zich niet in de machineruimten van categorie A bevinden), met dien verstande dat:  

  .3.1 brandstofolietanks, behalve die welke zijn geplaatst in afdelingen met een dubbele bodem, buiten de machineruimten van categorie A moeten worden geplaatst;  

  .3.2 voorzieningen moeten worden aangebracht voor de meting van de olietemperatuur op de aanzuigleiding van de brandstofoliepomp;  

  .3.3 afsluiters en/of kranen moeten worden aangebracht aan de inlaat- en uitlaatzijde van de brandstofoliefilters; en  

  .3.4 steeds waar mogelijk leidingenkoppelingen moeten worden gelast, of conuskoppelingen of sferische koppelingen moeten worden toegepast; en  

.4 op vrachtschepen kan het gebruik van brandstof met een lager vlampunt dan overigens in paragraaf 2.1 vermeld, bijvoorbeeld ruwe olie, worden toegestaan mits deze brandstof niet wordt opgeslagen in een machineruimte en onder voorbehoud van de goedkeuring van de gehele installatie door de Administratie.    

2.2 Inrichtingen voor brandstofolie Op een schip waar brandstofolie wordt gebruikt, moeten de inrichtingen voor de opslag, verdeling en het gebruik van brandstofolie zodanig zijn dat de veiligheid van het schip en van de personen aan boord zeker wordt gesteld; zij moeten ten minste voldoen aan de onderstaande bepalingen. 

2.2.1 Plaats van de brandstofoliesystemen Voor zover mogelijk mag geen gedeelte van het brandstofoliesysteem dat verwarmde olie onder een druk van meer dan 0,18 N/mm <sup>2</sup> bevat, dusdanig aan het oog onttrokken worden aangebracht, dat gebreken en lekkage niet gemakkelijk kunnen worden waargenomen. Ter plaatse van dergelijke onderdelen van het brandstofoliesysteem moet de machineruimte voldoende verlicht zijn.  

2.2.2 Ventilatie van de machineruimten De ventilatie van machineruimten moet onder alle normale omstandigheden voldoende zijn om ophoping van oliedampen te voorkomen.  

2.2.3 Brandstofolietanks 

2.2.3.1 Brandstofolie, smeerolie en andere ontvlambare oliën mogen niet in voorpiektanks worden vervoerd.  

2.2.3.2 Voor zover praktisch mogelijk moeten de brandstofolietanks deel uitmaken van de scheepsconstructie en buiten de machineruimten van categorie A gelegen zijn. Wanneer brandstofolietanks, met uitzondering van tanks in de dubbele bodem, noodzakelijkerwijze naast of in machineruimten van categorie A gelegen zijn, moet ten minste een van hun verticale wanden grenzen aan de buitenwand van de machineruimte en moeten zij bij voorkeur een gemeenschappelijke begrenzingswand hebben met tanks in de dubbele bodem en moet de oppervlakte van de begrenzingswand tussen de tank en de machineruimte zo klein mogelijk zijn. Wanneer dergelijke tanks zich bevinden binnen de begrenzing van machineruimten van categorie A, mogen zij geen brandstofolie bevatten waarvan het vlampunt beneden de 60 °C ligt. Over het algemeen moet het gebruik van losse brandstofolietanks worden vermeden. Wanneer zulke tanks worden gebruikt, mogen zij niet zijn gelegen in machineruimten van categorie A op passagiersschepen. Indien zij zijn toegestaan moeten zij zijn opgesteld in een oliedichte lekbak van ruime afmetingen die is voorzien van een geschikte afvoerpijp die voert naar een lekolietank van voldoende afmeting.  

2.2.3.3 Brandstofolietanks mogen niet zodanig zijn gelegen dat druppelen of lekken van vloeistof daaruit op hete oppervlakken een gevaar voor brand of ontploffing kan vormen.  

2.2.3.4 Iedere brandstofolieleiding waaruit bij beschadiging olie zou kunnen ontsnappen uit een boven de dubbele bodem opgestelde voorraad-, bezink- of dagtank met een inhoud van 500 l of meer moet zijn voorzien van een kraan of afsluiter direct aan de tank die vanaf een veilige plaats buiten de betrokken ruimten waarin zulke tanks zijn geplaatst, kan worden gesloten in het geval dat in die ruimte brand uitbreekt. In het bijzondere geval van dieptetanks in een schroefas- of pijpentunnel of soortgelijke ruimte moeten afsluiters op de tanks zijn aangebracht, doch de afsluiting in het geval van brand mag worden bewerkstelligd door middel van een extra afsluiter in de leiding of leidingen buiten de tunnel of soortgelijke ruimte. Indien deze extra afsluiter in de machineruimte is aangebracht moet zij bedienbaar zijn vanaf een plaats buiten die ruimte. De organen voor bediening op afstand van de afsluiter voor de brandstoftank van de noodgenerator moet zich in andere ruimte bevinden dan de organen voor de bediening op afstand van andere afsluiters voor tanks gelegen in machineruimten.  

2.2.3.5 Veilige en doeltreffende middelen moeten aanwezig zijn om de hoeveelheid brandstofolie in een tank te bepalen. 

2.2.3.5.1 Wanneer peilpijpen worden gebruikt, mogen deze niet uitkomen in enige ruimte waar gevaar aanwezig is voor ontsteking van olie die uit de peilpijpen kan overvloeien. In het bijzonder mogen zij niet uitkomen in ruimten voor passagiers of bemanning. Als algemene regel geldt dat zij niet mogen uitkomen in machineruimten. Indien de Administratie echter van oordeel is dat laatstgenoemde vereisten praktisch niet uitvoerbaar zijn, kan zij toestaan dat peilpijpen wel uitkomen in machineruimten, mits aan de volgende eisen wordt voldaan: 

.1 er moet een olieniveaupeilinrichting aanwezig zijn, die moet voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 2.2.3.5.2;  

.2 de peilpijpen moeten uitkomen op plaatsen waar geen gevaar voor ontsteking bestaat, tenzij voorzorgsmaatregelen zijn getroffen, zoals het aanbrengen van doeltreffende afscherming om te voorkomen dat brandstofolie die uit uiteinden van de peilpijpen vloeit in contact komt met een ontstekingsbron;  

.3 de uiteinden van peilpijpen moeten zijn voorzien van zelfsluitende afsluitmiddelen en van een daaronder geplaatst zelfsluitend controlekraantje van geringe doorsnede, teneinde, alvorens het afsluitmiddel te openen, te kunnen vaststellen dat zich aldaar geen brandstofolie bevindt. Er moeten voorzieningen worden getroffen om te waarborgen dat brandstofolie afkomstig uit het controlekraantje geen gevaar voor ontsteking oplevert.    

2.2.3.5.2 In plaats van peilpijpen mogen andere olieniveaupeilinrichtingen worden gebruikt, mits deze voldoen aan de volgende voorwaarden: 

.1 aan boord van passagiersschepen mag voor zulke afsluiters doorboring van de tank onder de bovenkant daarvan niet nodig zijn en mag het onklaar raken van die afsluiters of het overvullen van de tanks het niet mogelijk maken dat brandstofolie buiten de tanks geraakt; en  

.2 aan boord van vrachtschepen mag het onklaar raken van die afsluiters of het overvullen van de tanks het niet mogelijk maken dat brandstofolie buiten de tanks in de ruimte terechtkomt. Het gebruik van cilindrische peilglazen is verboden. De Administratie kan het gebruik toestaan van olieniveaupeilinrichtingen met platte glazen en zelfsluitende kranen tussen de peilglazen en de brandstoftanks.    

2.2.3.5.3 De in de paragrafen 2.2.3.5.2 voorgeschreven middelen die door de Administratie zijn goedgekeurd, moeten goed kunnen worden onderhouden teneinde een voortdurend juiste aanwijzing te verzekeren.      

2.2.4 Voorkoming van overdruk Voorzieningen moeten worden getroffen ter vermijding van overdruk in een brandstofolietank of in een gedeelte van het brandstofoliesysteem, met inbegrip van de vulpijpen die door pompen aan boord worden bediend. Lucht- of overvloeipijpen en ontlastkleppen moeten uitkomen op een plaats waar geen gevaar voor brand of ontploffing bestaat als gevolg van de aanwezigheid van olie en damp en mogen niet uitkomen in ruimten voor bemanning of ruimten voor passagiers, noch in ruimten van bijzondere aard, gesloten ro-ro-laadruimten, machineruimten of soortgelijke ruimten.  

2.2.5 Brandstofolieleidingen 

2.2.5.1 Brandstofolieleidingen en de afsluiters en onderdelen hiervan moeten van staal of ander goedgekeurd materiaal zijn; beperkt gebruik van flexibele leidingen is echter toegestaan op plaatsen waar deze naar het oordeel van de Administratie noodzakelijk zijn. Zulke flexibele leidingen en hun eindbevestigingen moeten van goedgekeurd brandbestendig materiaal van voldoende sterkte zijn en hun constructie moet ten genoegen van de Administratie zijn. Voor afsluiters die op brandstofolietanks zijn gemonteerd en die onder statische druk staan, kan staal of gietijzer met bolvormig grafiet worden geaccepteerd. Gewone gietijzeren afsluiters mogen evenwel worden gebruikt bij leidingsystemen waarbij de ontwerpdruk lager is dan 7 bar en de ontwerptemperatuur lager is dan 60 °C.  

2.2.5.2 Alle uitwendig aangebrachte hogedruk-brandstoftoevoerleidingen tussen de hogedruk-brandstofpompen en de branstofinjectoren moeten worden beschermd door middel van een ommanteling waarin brandstof die als gevolg van een defecte hogedrukleiding weglekt, kan worden opgevangen. De ommanteling vormt één geheel en bestaat uit een buitenleiding waarin de hogedruk-brandstofleiding is aangebracht. De ommanteling moet worden voorzien van een systeem voor het opvangen van gelekte brandstof en er moeten voorzieningen worden aangebracht opdat er een alarm in werking treedt bij defecten aan een brandstofleiding.  

2.2.5.3 Brandstofolieleidingen mogen niet worden gemonteerd rechtstreeks boven of in de nabijheid van voorzieningen die hitte afgeven, zoals ketels, stoomleidingen, uitlaatspruitstukken, geluiddempers of andere uitrusting die in overeenstemming met paragraaf 2.2.6 moeten worden geïsoleerd. Voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar moeten brandstofolieleidingen ver uit de buurt van hete oppervlakken, elektrische installaties en andere ontstekingsbronnen worden aangebracht en moeten zij worden afgeschermd of anderszins op passende wijze worden beschermd om het sproeien of lekken van olie op de ontstekingsbronnen te voorkomen. Het aantal koppelingen in zulke leidingstelsels moet tot een minimum worden beperkt.  

2.2.5.4 Bij het ontwerp van onderdelen van een dieselmotor-brandstofsysteem moet rekening worden gehouden met de maximumpiekdruk die heerst tijdens de werking ervan, met inbegrip van hogedrukpulsen die worden opgewekt en door de werking van brandstofinjectiepompen in de brandstoftoevoer- en lekleidingen worden teruggevoerd. Bij de constructie van aansluitingen binnen de brandstoftoevoer- en lekleidingen moet ervoor worden gezorgd dat lekkages van onder druk staande olie tijdens de werking en na het onderhoud ervan, wordt voorkomen.  

2.2.5.5 Bij installaties met meerdere motoren die uit dezelfde brandstofbron worden gevoed, moeten de brandstoftoevoer- en lekleidingen naar de afzonderlijke motoren worden geïsoleerd. Het isolatiemiddel mag de werking van de andere motoren niet beïnvloeden en moet kunnen worden bediend vanuit een positie die door brand bij een van de motoren niet ontoegankelijk wordt gemaakt.  

2.2.5.6 In het geval dat de Administratie het vervoer van olie en brandbare vloeistoffen door ruimten voor accommodatie en dienstruimten toestaat, moeten de leidingen die de olie of brandbare vloeistoffen vervoeren, bestaan uit materiaal dat uit oogpunt van brandgevaar door de Administratie is goedgekeurd.    

2.2.6 Beveiliging van oppervlakken met een hoge temperatuur 

2.2.6.1 Oppervlakken met een temperatuur hoger dan 220 °C die in geval van een defect aan het brandstofsysteem met brandstof in aanraking kunnen komen, moeten deugdelijk worden geïsoleerd.  

2.2.6.2 Er moeten maatregelen worden getroffen om te voorkomen dat olie onder druk uit een pomp, filter of verwarmingsinstallatie met hete oppervlakken in aanraking komt.      

2.3 Inrichtingen voor smeerolie 

2.3.1 De inrichtingen voor de opslag, verdeling en het gebruik van olie in smeeroliesystemen onder druk moeten zodanig zijn, dat de veiligheid van het schip en van de zich aan boord bevindende personen is verzekerd. Inrichtingen aangebracht in machineruimten van categorie A en, waar mogelijk, in andere machineruimten, moeten ten minste voldoen aan het bepaalde in de paragrafen 2.2.1, 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.4, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.4, 2.2.5.1, 2.2.5.3 en 2.2.6, met dien verstande: 

.1 dat dit het gebruik van kijkglazen in de smeerolieleidingen niet uitsluit, mits door middel van een proef wordt aangetoond dat zij voldoende brandbestendig zijn; en  

.2 dat peilpijpen in machineruimten kunnen worden toegelaten; aan de eisen van de paragrafen 2.2.3.5.1.1 en 2.2.3.5.1.3 behoeft niet te worden voldaan, mits de peilpijpen zijn voorzien van doelmatige afsluitmiddelen.    

2.3.2 De bepalingen van paragraaf 2.2.3.4 zijn eveneens van toepassing op smeerolietanks, behoudens die welke een capaciteit hebben van minder dan 500 l, op opslagtanks waarvan de afsluiters bij normale werking van het schip gesloten zijn, of wanneer vast staat dat een onbedoelde werking van een snelsluitklep van de smeerolietank de veilige werking van de hoofdvoortstuwingsinstallatie en wezenlijke hulpmachines in gevaar zou brengen.    

2.4 Inrichtingen voor andere ontvlambare oliën De inrichtingen voor de opslag, verdeling en het gebruik van andere ontvlambare oliën die onder druk worden gebruikt in systemen voor het overbrengen van vermogens-, bedienings-, bekrachtigings-, en verwarmingssystemen moeten zodanig zijn dat de veiligheid van het schip en de personen aan boord verzekerd is. Onder hydraulische kleppen en cilinders moeten deugdelijke inrichtingen voor het opvangen van gelekte olie worden aangebracht. Op plaatsen waar ontstekingsbronnen aanwezig zijn, moeten dergelijke inrichtingen ten minste voldoen aan de bepalingen van de paragrafen 2.2.3.3, 2.2.3.5, 2.2.5.3.en 2.2.6 en ten aanzien van sterkte en constructie aan de bepalingen van paragraaf 2.2.4 en 2.2.5.1.  

2.5 Inrichtingen voor brandstofolie in machineruimten die periodiek zonder toezicht zijn Naast de vereisten vervat in de paragrafen 2.1 tot en met 2.4, moeten brandstofolie- en smeeroliesystemen in machineruimten die periodiek zonder toezicht zijn, voldoen aan de volgende bepalingen: 

.1 wanneer brandstofoliedagtanks automatisch of met behulp van afstandbediening worden gevuld, moeten middelen zijn aangebracht ter voorkoming van lekken door overvulling. Ook andere apparatuur waarin brandbare vloeistoffen automatisch worden verwerkt, (zoals brandstofolie-reinigers) die, waar mogelijk, moeten zijn opgesteld in een speciale, voor reinigers en bijbehorende verwarmingsvoorzieningen gereserveerde ruimte, moet zijn uitgerust met voorzieningen ter voorkoming van lekken door overvulling; en  

.2 wanneer brandstofoliedagtanks of bezinktanks zijn uitgerust met verwarmingsvoorzieningen, moet er een hoge-temperatuuralarm zijn aangebracht als het vlampunt van de brandstofolie kan worden overschreden.      

3. Voorzieningen voor gasvormige brandstof voor huishoudelijke doeleinden Systemen voor gasvormige brandstof voor huishoudelijke doeleinden moeten door de Administratie worden goedgekeurd. Opslag van gasflessen moet geschieden op het open dek of in een goed geventileerde ruimte die uitsluitend een uitgang naar het open dek biedt.  

4. Diversen op het gebied van ontstekingsbronnen en ontbrandingscapaciteit 

4.1 Elektrische kachels Elektrische kachels moeten, indien gebruikt, vast zijn bevestigd en moeten zo zijn ingericht dat het brandgevaar tot een minimum is beperkt. Deze kachels mogen niet zijn voorzien van een verwarmingselement dat kleding, gordijnen of andere soortgelijke materialen kan doen schroeien of in brand doen geraken door de door het element geleverde hitte.  

4.2 Afvalbakken Afvalbakken moeten zijn vervaardigd van onbrandbare materialen en mogen geen openingen in de zijkanten of bodem hebben.  

4.3 Beveiliging van isolatie-oppervlakken tegen oliedoordringing In ruimten waarin olieproducten zouden kunnen doordringen, moet het oppervlak van de isolatie ondoordringbaar zijn voor olie of oliedampen.  

4.4 Onderste laag van dekbedekkingen De onderste laag van dekbedekkingen in ruimten voor accommodatie, dienstruimten en controlestations of indien toegepast op hutbalkons van passagiersschepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2008 moet van goedgekeurd materiaal zijn dat niet gemakkelijk kan ontbranden; dit moet worden aangetoond in overeenstemming met de Code inzake beproevingsprocedures voor brandwerendheid.    

5. Ladinggedeelten van tankschepen 

5.1 Scheiding van ladingolietanks 

5.1.1 Ladingpompkamers, ladingtanks, sloptanks en kofferdammen moeten vóór de machineruimten gelegen zijn. Brandstofolietanks behoeven echter niet vóór machineruimten gelegen te zijn. Ladingtanks en sloptanks moeten van machineruimten zijn afgescheiden door kofferdammen, ladingpompkamers, brandstofolietanks of ballasttanks. Pompkamers die pompen en hun toebehoren bevatten voor het ballasten van ruimten die naast ladingtanks en sloptanks zijn gelegen, alsmede pompen voor het verpompen van brandstofolie, zijn, binnen de samenhang van dit voorschrift, gelijkwaardig aan een ladingpompkamer, mits dergelijke pompkamers aan dezelfde veiligheidseisen voldoen als die welke zijn voorgeschreven voor ladingpompkamers. Pompkamers die uitsluitend bedoeld zijn voor het verpompen van ballast of brandstofolie behoeven evenwel niet aan de vereisten van voorschrift 10.9 te voldoen. Het onderste deel van de ladingpompkamers mag als een nis in de machineruimten van categorie A zijn uitgevoerd ten behoeve van de opstelling van pompen, mits de bovenzijde van de nis op een hoogte van niet meer dan een derde van de holte naar de mal boven de kiellijn is gelegen, met dien verstande dat, indien kan worden aangetoond dat vanwege de toegankelijkheid en de goede legging van de pijpen deze afstand bezwaarlijk is, de Administratie voor een schip met een draagvermogen van niet meer dan 25.000 ton een grotere hoogte van bedoelde nis kan toestaan, doch niet groter dan de helft van de holte naar de mal.  

5.1.2 Hoofdcontrolestations voor lading, controlestations, ruimten voor accommodatie en dienstruimten (met uitzondering van vrijstaande bergplaatsen voor gerei voor ladingbehandeling) moeten zijn gelegen achter alle ladingtanks, sloptanks en ruimten die lading- of sloptanks afscheiden van machineruimten, doch niet noodzakelijkerwijs achter brandstofolietanks en waterballasttanks, maar zij moeten zodanig zijn aangebracht, dat falen van een dek of een schot er niet toe kan leiden dat gassen of dampen uit de ladingtanks binnendringen in een ruimte voor accommodatie, hoofdcontrolestations voor lading, controlestations of dienstruimten. Met een nis, mits in overeenstemming met het bepaalde in paragraaf 5.1.1, behoeft geen rekening te worden gehouden bij het vaststellen van de plaats van deze ruimten.  

5.1.3 Echter, indien zulks noodzakelijk is, kan de Administratie toestaan dat hoofdcontrolestations voor lading, controlestations, ruimten voor accommodatie en dienstruimten zijn gelegen vóór ladingtanks, sloptanks en ruimten die de lading- en sloptanks afscheiden van de machineruimten, doch niet noodzakelijkerwijs voor brandstoftanks of waterballasttanks. Andere machineruimten dan die van categorie A mogen zijn gelegen vóór ladingtanks en sloptanks, mits zij van de ladingtanks en de sloptanks zijn afgescheiden door kofferdammen, ladingpompkamers, brandstofolietanks of waterballasttanks, en zijn voorzien van ten minste één draagbaar brandblusapparaat. In gevallen waarin zij verbrandingsmotoren of gasturbines bevatten, moet in aanvulling op draagbare brandblussapparaten worden voorzien in een goedgekeurd schuimblusapparaat met een capaciteit van ten minste 45 l of met gelijkwaardige capaciteit. Indien het gebruik van een half-draagbaar brandblusapparaat niet praktisch uitvoerbaar is, mag dit brandblusapparaat worden vervangen door twee aanvullende draagbare brandblusapparaten. Ruimten voor accommodatie, hoofdcontrolestations voor lading, controlestations en dienstruimten moeten zodanig zijn ingericht, dat falen van een dek of schot er niet toe kan leiden dat gassen of dampen uit de ladingtanks binnendringen in deze ruimten. Bovendien kan de Administratie toestaan, indien zulks noodzakelijk is voor de veiligheid of manoeuvreerbaarheid van het schip, dat de machineruimten waarin verbrandingsmotoren of gasturbines staan opgesteld, niet zijnde hoofdvoortstuwingswerktuigen met een vermogen groter dan 375 kW, vóór het ladinggedeelte zijn gelegen, mits de voorzieningen in overeenstemming zijn met het bepaalde in deze paragraaf.  

5.1.4 Alleen voor combination carriers: 

.1 De sloptanks moeten zijn omgeven door kofferdammen, behalve waar de scheidingswanden van de sloptanks deel uitmaken van de huid, het hoofddek, het ladingpompkamerschot of een schot van een brandstofolietank. Deze kofferdammen mogen niet in open verbinding staan met een dubbele bodem, pijpentunnel, pompkamer of andere omsloten ruimte; zij mogen ook niet worden gebruikt voor lading of ballast of worden aangesloten op pijpenstelsels naar olielading of ballast. Er moeten voorzieningen zijn aangebracht om de kofferdammen met water te kunnen vullen en leeg te pompen. Indien het ladingpompkamerschot de begrenzing vormt van de sloptank, mag de pompkamer niet in open verbinding staan met de dubbele bodem, pijpentunnel of andere omsloten ruimte; openingen voorzien van deksels met bouten op gasdichte steek zijn echter toegestaan.  

.2 Voorzieningen moeten zijn aangebracht om in de pijpverbindingen tussen de pompkamer en de sloptanks als aangegeven in paragraaf 5.1.4.1 een afscheiding aan te brengen. Deze voorziening moet bestaan uit een afsluiter, gevolgd door een brilflens of een wegneembaar pijpstuk met bijbehorende blindflenzen. Deze voorziening moet direct grenzend aan de sloptanks zijn aangebracht, maar mag, waar dit niet uitvoerbaar of praktisch is, in de pompkamer direct achter de doorvoering door het schot zijn aangebracht. Een vast aangebracht afzonderlijk pomp- en pijpleidingsysteem, dat een verzamelleiding omvat, voorzien van een afsluiter en een blindflens, moet zijn aangebracht om de inhoud van de sloptanks direct via het open dek aan de havenontvangstinstallatie te kunnen afgeven, wanneer het schip wordt gebruikt voor het vervoer van stortlading. Wanneer het pompsysteem wordt gebruikt voor slopoverbrenging bij het vervoer van stortlading, mag dit systeem geen verbinding met andere systemen hebben. Afscheiding van andere systemen door middel van een wegneembaar pijpstuk mag worden geaccepteerd;  

.3 Luikhoofden en tankwasopeningen op de sloptanks zijn alleen toegestaan op het open dek en moeten zijn voorzien van afsluitmiddelen. Behalve wanneer deze bestaan uit platen met bouten op waterdichte steek, moeten deze afsluitmiddelen kunnen worden afgesloten met sloten waarvan de sleutels zich onder het beheer van de verantwoordelijke scheepsofficier moeten bevinden; en  

.4 Indien ladingzijtanks zijn aangebracht, moeten de ladingolieleidingen die onder het dek zijn gelegen, in deze tanks zijn aangebracht. De Administratie kan echter toestaan dat ladingolieleidingen in een speciale koker zijn aangebracht, waarvan de uitvoering te haren genoegen moet zijn en welke naar haar oordeel afdoende moet kunnen worden schoongemaakt en geventileerd. Indien geen ladingzijtanks zijn aangebracht, moeten de ladingolieleidingen die onder het dek zijn gelegen, in speciale kokers zijn aangebracht.    

5.1.5 Indien wordt aangetoond dat het aanbrengen van een stuurhuis boven het ladinggedeelte noodzakelijk is, mag dit stuurhuis uitsluitend zijn bestemd voor navigatiedoeleinden en moet het van het ladingdek zijn gescheiden door een open ruimte met een hoogte van ten minste 2 m. Bovendien moet de brandbeveiliging van een dergelijk stuurhuis zijn uitgevoerd zoals voor controlestations is voorgeschreven in voorschrift 9.2.4.2, en in andere op tankschepen van toepassing zijnde bepalingen.  

5.1.6 Voorzieningen moeten zijn aangebracht om eventueel aan dek vloeiende olie op een afstand van ruimten voor accommodatie en van dienstruimten te houden. Een dergelijke voorziening kan bestaan uit een vast aangebrachte, van boord tot boord lopende, stalen rand van ten minste 300 mm. Bijzondere aandacht moet worden besteed aan voorzieningen die samenhangen met laden of lossen over het achterschip.    

5.2 Beperkingen ten aanzien van openingen in scheidingswanden 

5.2.1 Tenzij toegestaan op grond van paragraaf 5.2.2 hieronder, mogen toegangsdeuren, luchtinlaten en openingen tot ruimten voor accommodatie, dienstruimten, controlestations en machineruimten niet tegenover het ladinggedeelte zijn gelegen. Dergelijke voorzieningen moeten zijn aangebracht in het dwarsschot dat niet tegenover het ladinggedeelte is gelegen, dan wel in de buitenste begrenzing in de zijde van de bovenbouw of het dekhuis op een afstand van niet minder dan 4% van de lengte van het schip, doch niet minder dan 3 m, van het einde van de bovenbouw of het dekhuis dat tegenover het ladinggedeelte is gelegen. Deze afstand hoeft echter niet meer dan 5 m te bedragen.  

5.2.2 De Administratie kan toestaan dat in begrenzingsschotten gelegen tegenover het ladinggedeelte of binnen de in paragraaf 5.2.1 aangegeven begrenzingen van 5 m, toegangsdeuren zijn aangebracht naar hoofdcontrolestations voor lading en dienstruimten als provisieruimten, bergplaatsen en bergkasten, mits deze noch direct, noch indirect toegang geven tot andere ruimten die zijn ingericht of dienst doen als ruimten voor accommodatie of controlestations, dan wel dienstruimten als kombuizen, pantry’s of werkplaatsen, of soortgelijke ruimten die ontstekingsbronnen voor dampen bevatten. De begrenzingswanden van genoemde ruimten moeten zijn geïsoleerd volgens de norm voor klasse „A-60”, met uitzondering van de begrenzingswand tegenover het ladinggedeelte. Binnen de in paragraaf 5.2.1 aangegeven begrenzingen mogen platen met bouten voor het verplaatsen van machineonderdelen zijn aangebracht. Deuren naar en ramen in het stuurhuis mogen binnen de in paragraaf 5.2.1 aangegeven begrenzingen zijn gelegen, mits zij zodanig zijn ontworpen en uitgevoerd, dat het stuurhuis snel en doelmatig gas- en dampdicht kan worden afgesloten.  

5.2.3 Ramen en patrijspoorten aangebracht in wanden tegenover het ladinggedeelte en in de zijden van bovenbouwen en dekhuizen binnen de in paragraaf 5.2.1 aangegeven begrenzingen moeten van het vaste, niet-openende type zijn. Deze ramen en patrijspoorten, behalve ramen in het stuurhuis, moeten worden geconstrueerd volgens de norm voor klasse „A-60” behoudens dat de norm voor klasse „A-0” aanvaardbaar is voor ramen en patrijspoorten buiten de in voorschrift 9.2.4.2.5 vermelde limiet.  

5.2.4 Wanneer vanuit een leidingtunnel een permanente toegang is tot de hoofdpompkamer, moet een waterdichte deur worden geïnstalleerd die voldoet aan de vereisten van voorschrift II-1/13-1.2 en aan het onderstaande: 

.1 de waterdichte deur moet niet alleen vanaf de brug kunnen worden bediend, maar ook handmatig kunnen worden gesloten vanaf een positie buiten de ingang van de hoofdpompkamer; en  

.2 de waterdichte deur moet gesloten blijven tijdens normaal bedrijf van het schip, tenzij toegang moet worden verkregen tot de leidingtunnel.    

5.2.5 In schotten en dekken die ladingpompkamers van andere ruimten scheiden, mogen blijvende, goedgekeurde, gasdichte verlichtingsarmaturen worden toegestaan voor verlichting ten behoeve van de ladingpompkamers, mits deze sterk genoeg zijn en de brandwerendheid en gasdichtheid van het schot of dek gehandhaafd blijven.  

5.2.6 De ventilatie-inlaat- en -uitlaatopeningen en andere openingen in de begrenzingswanden van het dekhuis en de bovenbouw moeten zodanig zijn aangebracht dat hiermee de aanvulling op het bepaalde in paragraaf 5.3 en voorschrift 11.6 wordt gevormd. Dergelijke ventilatie-openingen moeten, met name voor machineruimten, zo ver mogelijk naar achteren worden aangebracht. Wanneer een schip is uitgerust voor laden of lossen over het achterschip moet daarmee, in dit verband, naar behoren rekening worden gehouden. Bronnen van ontsteking, zoals elektrische uitrusting, moeten zodanig zijn opgesteld dat gevaar voor ontploffing wordt voorkomen.    

5.3 Ontluchting van ladingtanks 

5.3.1 Algemene vereisten De ontluchtingssystemen voor ladingtanks moeten volledig gescheiden zijn van de luchtkanalen van andere ruimten in het schip. De voorzieningen en de plaatsing van openingen in het ladingtankdek van waaruit ontvlambare dampen kunnen uitstromen, moeten zodanig zijn dat er zo min mogelijk kans bestaat dat ontvlambare dampen kunnen binnenstromen in omsloten ruimten die een ontstekingsbron bevatten of zich ophopen in de buurt van machines of uitrusting aan dek, waardoor een risico voor ontsteking kan ontstaan. Overeenkomstig dit algemene beginsel worden de in paragraaf 5.3.2 tot en met 5.3.5 en in voorschrift 11.6 vervatte maatstaven gehanteerd.  

5.3.2 Ontluchtingsvoorzieningen 

5.3.2.1 De ontluchtingsvoorzieningen in iedere ladingtank mogen onafhankelijk zijn of mogen worden gecombineerd met die van andere ladingtanks en mogen een onderdeel zijn van het pijpleidingsysteem van de inert-gasinstallatie.  

5.3.2.2 Wanneer de voorzieningen zijn gecombineerd met die voor andere ladingtanks, moeten hetzij afsluiters, hetzij andere aanvaardbare middelen zijn aangebracht om iedere ladingtank te kunnen isoleren. Wanneer afsluiters zijn aangebracht, moeten deze zijn voorzien van een blokkeerinrichting met een slot waarvan de sleutel in beheer is bij de verantwoordelijke officier. Duidelijke standaardaanwijzingslampjes voor de operationele toestand van de kleppen of andere acceptabele middelen moeten aanwezig zijn. Indien tanks zijn afgesloten, moet gewaarborgd zijn dat de desbetreffende afsluitkleppen worden geopend voordat wordt begonnen met het laden, ballasten of lossen van deze tanks. Bij iedere vorm van afsluiting moet de stroming die wordt veroorzaakt door temperatuurschommelingen in een ladingtank overeenkomstig voorschrift 11.6.1.1, steeds mogelijk blijven.  

5.3.2.3 Indien een ladingtank of groep ladingtanks die van een algemeen ontluchtingssysteem is afgesloten, moet worden geladen en geballast of gelost, moet deze ladingtank of groep ladingtanks worden voorzien van een beveiliging tegen overdruk of onderdruk als vereist in voorschrift 11.6.3.2.  

5.3.2.4 De ontluchtingsvoorzieningen moeten zijn aangesloten op de bovenzijde van iedere ladingtank en moeten onder alle normale omstandigheden van trim en slagzij van het schip automatisch vloeistof kunnen afvoeren naar de ladingtanks. Waar dit laatste eventueel niet mogelijk is, moet een vast aangebrachte afvoer aanwezig zijn tussen de ontluchtingsleiding en de ladingtank.    

5.3.3 Veiligheidsvoorzieningen in ontluchtingssystemen In het ontluchtingssysteem moeten voorzieningen zijn opgenomen ter voorkoming van vlamdoorslag naar een ladingtank. Deze voorzieningen moeten qua ontwerp, beproeving en plaatsing voldoen aan de door de Organisatie gestelde eisen waarin ten minste de door de Organisatie aangenomen normen moeten zijn opgenomen. Ullage-openingen mogen niet worden gebruikt voor drukverdeling. Deze moeten zijn voorzien van zelfsluitende en strak afsluitende deksels. In deze openingen mogen geen vlamstoppers en -schermen worden aangebracht.  

5.3.4 Ontluchtingsuitlaten voor ladingverwerking en ballasten 

5.3.4.1 De krachtens voorschrift 11.6.1.2 voor het laden, lossen en ballasten vereiste ontluchtingsuitlaten moeten: 

.1.1 de vrije uitstroming van dampmengsels mogelijk maken; of  

.1.2 de mogelijkheid bieden de afvoer van dampmengsels te smoren teneinde een snelheid van minder dan 30 m/s te verkrijgen; 

.2 zodanig zijn aangebracht dat het dampmengsel in verticale opwaartse richting wordt afgevoerd;  

.3 wanneer de afvoer plaatsvindt door vrije uitstroming van dampmengsels, zodanig zijn dat de uitlaat zich bevindt op een hoogte van niet minder dan 6 m boven het ladingtankdek of, boven een loopbrug indien de uitlaat op een afstand van minder dan 4 m vanaf die loopbrug is gelegen; tevens moet deze uitlaat zich bevinden op een afstand van ten minste 10 m, horizontaal gemeten, vanaf de dichtstbijzijnde luchtinlaten en openingen naar omsloten ruimten die een bron van ontsteking bevatten en vanaf werktuigen aan dek, waaronder openingen in ankerspillen en kettingkisten, en uitrusting die een risico voor ontsteking kan opleveren; en  

.4 wanneer de afvoer plaatsvindt met hoge snelheid, zich bevinden op een hoogte van niet minder dan 2 m boven het ladingtankdek en op een afstand van minder dan 10 m, horizontaal gemeten, vanaf de dichtstbijzijnde luchtinlaten en openingen naar omsloten ruimten die een bron van ontsteking bevatten en vanaf machines, waaronder openingen in ankerspillen en kettingkisten, en uitrusting aan dek die een risico voor ontsteking kan opleveren. Deze uitlaten moeten zijn voorzien van middelen van een goedgekeurd type om een hoge uitstroomsnelheid te verzekeren.      

5.3.4.2 De voorzieningen voor het ontluchten van dampen die gedurende het laden en ballasten uit de ladingtanks worden verplaatst, moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 5.3 en voorschrift 11.6 en moeten bestaan uit een of meerdere stijgmasten, of uit een aantal ontluchtingsvoorzieningen die een hoge uitstroomsnelheid verzekeren. Voor deze ontluchting mag de hoofdaanvoerleiding voor inert gas worden gebruikt.    

5.3.5 Isolatie van sloptanks op combination carriers Op combination carriers moeten de voorzieningen om sloptanks met olie of olieresten af te sluiten van andere ladingtanks, bestaan uit blinde flenzen die te allen tijde op hun plaats blijven wanneer er andere lading dan vloeibare lading als bedoeld in voorschrift 1.6.1 wordt vervoerd.    

5.4 Ventilatie 

5.4.1 Ventilatiesystemen in ladingpompkamers Ladingpompkamers moeten mechanisch worden geventileerd en de uitlaten van de afzuigventilatoren moeten naar een veilige plaats op het open dek worden geleid. De ventilatie van deze pompkamers moet voldoende capaciteit hebben om de mogelijkheid van opeenhoping van ontvlambare dampen tot een minimum te beperken. Het aantal luchtwisselingen moet ten minste 20 per uur bedragen, gebaseerd op het brutovolume van de ruimte. De ventilatiekokers moeten zo zijn aangelegd dat de gehele ruimte doeltreffend wordt geventileerd. De ventilatie moet plaatsvinden door afzuiging, waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van vonkvrije ventilatoren.  

5.4.2 Ventilatiesystemen op combination carriers Op combination carriers moeten laadruimten en alle aan laadruimten grenzende ingesloten ruimten mechanisch kunnen worden geventileerd. De mechanische ventilatie kan plaatsvinden met behulp van draagbare ventilatoren. In ladingpompkamers en pijpentunnels en kofferdammen als bedoel in paragraaf 5.1.4 die grenzen aan sloptanks, moet een goedgekeurde vast aangebrachte gasmeldingsinstallatie aanwezig zijn die waarschuwt voor de aanwezigheid van ontvlambare dampen. Er moeten deugdelijke voorzieningen zijn aangebracht om de meting van de hoeveelheid ontvlambare dampen in alle andere ruimten binnen het ladinggedeelte mogelijk te maken. Het moet mogelijk zijn zulke metingen te verrichten vanaf het open dek of gemakkelijk toegankelijke plaatsen.    

5.5 Inert-gasinstallaties 

5.5.1 Toepassing 

5.5.1.1 Voor tankschepen met een draagvermogen van 20.000 ton of meer moeten de ladingtanks worden beschermd door middel van een vast aangebrachte inert-gasinstallatie, overeenkomstig de vereisten vervat in de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen, met dien verstande dat, in plaats hiervan, de Administratie, na bestudering van de op het schip aanwezige voorzieningen en uitrusting, andere vast aangebrachte installaties kan aanvaarden, indien de hierdoor geboden beveiliging gelijkwaardig is aan die welke bovengenoemde installatie biedt, overeenkomstig voorschrift I/5. De vereisten voor andere vast aangebrachte installaties moeten conform zijn aan die welke in paragraaf 5.5.4 worden genoemd.

9.2 Het controlepaneel van vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallaties moet zodanig zijn ontworpen dat een storing in het systeem door het systeem zelf wordt aangegeven (zodat bijv. alarm wordt gegeven bij een open detectorcircuit).  

9.3 Op passagiersschepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren moeten de door paragraaf 5.2 voorgeschreven brandalarminstallaties worden samengebracht in een doorlopend bemand centraal controlestation. Daarnaast moet de bedieningsapparatuur voor het op afstand sluiten van branddeuren en het stopzetten van ventilatoren worden samengebracht op dezelfde plaats. De ventilatoren moeten door de bemanning op het doorlopend bemande controlestation weer in werking kunnen worden gesteld. De controlepanelen in het centrale controlestation moeten in staat zijn aan te geven of branddeuren open of gesloten zijn en of detectors, alarmen en ventilatoren in- of uitgeschakeld zijn. Het controlepaneel moet voortdurend van stroom worden voorzien en beschikken over een automatische overschakeling op een noodstroomvoorziening ingeval de normale stroomvoorziening uitvalt. Het controlepaneel moet van stroom worden voorzien vanuit de hoofdstroomvoorziening en de noodstroomvoorziening omschreven in voorschrift II-1/42, tenzij in de voorschriften andere toepasselijke regelingen zijn toegestaan.  

9.4 Een speciale alarminstallatie die vanaf de navigatiebrug of het controlestation kan worden bediend, moet worden aangebracht ter oproeping van de bemanning. Dit alarm kan een deel zijn van de algemene alarminstallatie van het schip en moet onafhankelijk van het alarm in de passagiersruimten in werking kunnen worden gesteld.    

10 Beveiliging van hutbalkons op passagiersschepen Op hutbalkons van schepen waarop voorschrift 5.3.4 van toepassing is, moet, wanneer meubilair en inrichting op dergelijke balkons niet conform de voorschriften 3.40.1, 3.40.2, 3.40.3, 3.40.6 en 3.40.7 zijn, een vaste branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie zijn aangebracht die voldoet aan de bepalingen van de Code inzake brandveiligheidsystemen.    

### Voorschrift  8  

####Beheersing van de verspreiding van rook

1 Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is de verspreiding van rook te beheersen teneinde de door rook gevormde gevaren tot een minimum te beperken. Hiertoe moet worden voorzien in middelen voor de beheersing van rook in atriums, controlestations, machineruimten en verborgen ruimten.  

2 Beveiliging van controlestations die buiten machineruimten zijn gelegen Er moeten praktisch uitvoerbare maatregelen worden getroffen om te bereiken dat in controlestations die buiten machineruimten zijn gelegen, ventilatie, zicht en afwezigheid van rook worden gehandhaafd, zodat in geval van brand de werktuigen en toestellen daarin kunnen worden gecontroleerd en op deugdelijke wijze blijven werken. Een extra gescheiden systeem van luchttoevoer moet zijn aangebracht en de inlaatopeningen van beide systemen van luchttoevoer moeten zo zijn gelegen, dat het gevaar dat zij gelijktijdig rook aanzuigen tot een minimum beperkt blijft. Naar goeddunken van de Administratie behoeven dergelijke eisen niet te worden gesteld aan controlestations, gelegen op en uitgang verlenend naar een open dek, of daar waar plaatselijke afsluitmiddelen even doeltreffend zouden zijn.  

3. Afvoer van rook uit machineruimten 

3.1 De bepalingen van deze paragraaf zijn van toepassing op machineruimten van categorie A en, indien de Administratie zulks wenselijk acht, op andere machineruimten.  

3.2 Onverminderd de bepalingen van voorschrift 9.5.2.1 moeten passende voorzieningen worden getroffen voor de afvoer van rook uit de te beveiligen ruimte in geval van brand. Voor dit doel mag het gebruik van de normaliter gebruikte ventilatiesystemen worden toegestaan.  

3.3 Er moeten middelen voor de bediening van de rookafvoervoorziening worden aangebracht en deze middelen moeten zodanig buiten de betrokken ruimte zijn aangebracht dat deze, in geval van brand, niet worden geïsoleerd van de ruimte die zij bedienen.  

3.4 Op passagiersschepen moeten de in paragraaf 3.3 vereiste bedieningsmiddelen zijn aangebracht op één controleplaats of, ten genoegen van de Administratie, worden gegroepeerd op een zo gering mogelijk aantal plaatsen. Dergelijke plaatsen moeten vanaf het open dek veilig toegankelijk zijn.    

4 Afstoppingen die trek tegengaan Luchtruimten ingesloten achter plafonds, panelen of beschietingen moeten zijn onderverdeeld door goed sluitende afstoppingen, die niet meer dan 14 m van elkaar verwijderd mogen zijn. Zulke ingesloten luchtruimten moeten, met inbegrip van de ruimten achter beschietingen van trappenhuizen, schachten enzovoorts, in verticale richting op ieder dek zijn afgesloten.  

5 Rookafzuiginstallaties in atriums van passagiersschepen Atriums moeten worden voorzien van een rookafzuiginstallatie. De rookafzuiginstallatie moet worden geactiveerd door de vereiste rookdetectie-installatie en moet met de hand kunnen worden bediend. De capaciteit van de ventilatoren moet zodanig zijn dat het gehele volume binnen de ruimte kan worden afgezogen in 10 minuten of minder.    

### Voorschrift  9  

####Insluiting van brand

1 Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is een brand in te sluiten in de ruimte waarin deze is ontstaan. Hiertoe moet aan de volgende functionele vereisten worden voldaan: 

.1 het schip moet worden onderverdeeld door thermische en structurele scheidingswanden;  

.2 bij de thermische isolatie van scheidingswanden moet naar behoren rekening worden gehouden met het brandgevaar in de ruimte en aangrenzende ruimten; en  

.3 wanneer schotten zijn voorzien van openingen of doorboringen moet de brandwerendheid hiervan gehandhaafd blijven.    

2 Thermische en structurele scheidingswanden 

2.1 Thermische en structurele indeling Alle typen schepen moeten, aan de hand van het brandrisico binnen een bepaalde ruimte, door middel van thermische en structurele schotten in ruimten worden onderverdeeld.  

2.2 Passagiersschepen 

2.2.1 Verticale hoofdsecties en horizontale secties 

2.2.1.1.1 Op schepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren, moeten de romp, de bovenbouw en de dekhuizen worden onderverdeeld in verticale hoofdsecties door schotten van klasse „A-60”. Trapsgewijs verspringen van schotten moet, evenals het aanbrengen van nissen, zoveel mogelijk vermeden worden, doch waar dit nodig is moet de constructie eveneens uit schotten van klasse „A-60” bestaan. Indien zich aan één zijde een in paragraaf 2.2.3.2.2 omschreven ruimte van categorie (5), (9) of (10) bevindt of indien zich aan weerszijden van het schot brandstofolietanks bevinden, kan de norm worden verlaagd naar „A-0”  

2.2.1.1.2 Op schepen die niet meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren, moeten de romp, de bovenbouw en de dekhuizen, ter plaatse van ruimten voor accommodatie en dienstruimten, door schotten van klasse „A” worden onderverdeeld in verticale hoofdsecties. Deze schotten moeten een isolerend vermogen hebben overeenkomstig de tabellen in paragraaf 2.2.4.    

2.2.1.2 De schotten die de afscheiding vormen van de verticale hoofdsecties boven het schottendek moeten, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, in één vlak liggen met schotten voor de waterdichte indeling onmiddellijk onder het schottendek. De lengte en breedte van verticale hoofdsecties kunnen worden vergroot tot een maximum van 48 m om ervoor te zorgen dat de uiteinden van verticale hoofdsecties samenvallen met schotten voor de waterdichte indeling of om een grote openbare ruimte onder te brengen die zich uitstrekt over de gehele lengte van de verticale hoofdsectie, mits de totale oppervlakte van de verticale hoofdsectie op geen enkel dek groter is dan 1600 m <sup>2</sup>. De lengte of breedte van een verticale hoofdsectie is de maximumafstand tussen de verste punten van de eraan grenzende schotten.  

2.2.1.3 Deze schotten moeten van dek tot dek zijn doorgetrokken en doorlopen tot de huid of tot andere scheidingswanden.  

2.2.1.4 Indien een verticale hoofdsectie door horizontale schotten van klasse „A” wordt onderverdeeld in horizontale secties teneinde een passende scheiding aan te brengen tussen gedeelten van het schip die wel en gedeelten die niet van een sprinklersysteem zijn voorzien, moeten de schotten zijn doorgetrokken tussen de aangrenzende verticale hoofdbrandschotten en tot de huid of tot uitwendige scheidingswanden van het schip en moeten zij geïsoleerd zijn volgens de normen voor brandwerendheid en isolerend vermogen zoals vermeld in tabel 9.4. 

2.2.1.5.1 Op schepen die voor bijzondere doeleinden zijn ontworpen zoals veerboten voor het vervoer van automobielen of treinen, waar het aanbrengen van verticale hoofdbrandschotten het doel waarvoor het schip is bestemd zou belemmeren, moeten gelijkwaardige middelen tot het onder controle houden van brand en het voorkomen van uitbreiding daarvan ter vervanging van deze schotten worden aangebracht, welke middelen door de Administratie moeten zijn goedgekeurd. Dienstruimten en scheepsvoorraden mogen niet op ro-ro-dekken worden ondergebracht, tenzij deze conform de toepasselijke voorschriften worden beveiligd.  

2.2.1.5.2 Op schepen met ruimten van bijzondere aard, moeten dergelijke ruimten evenwel voldoen aan de toepasselijke bepalingen van voorschrift 20; wanneer zulks niet zou stroken met de in dit hoofdstuk vervatte andere vereisten voor passagiersschepen, zijn de vereisten van voorschrift 20 doorslaggevend.    

2.2.2 Schotten binnen een verticale hoofdsectie 

2.2.2.1 Op schepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren, moeten alle schotten die niet van klasse „A” behoeven te zijn, ten minste schotten van klasse „B” of „C” zijn zoals voorgeschreven in de tabellen in paragraaf 2.2.3.  

2.2.2.2 Op schepen die niet meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren, moeten alle schotten binnen ruimten voor accommodatie en dienstruimten die niet van klasse „A” behoeven te zijn, ten minste van klasse „B” of „C” zijn, zoals voorgeschreven in de tabellen in paragraaf 2.2.4. Daarnaast moeten alle schotten van gangen, indien zij niet van klasse „A” behoeven te zijn, schotten van klasse „B” zijn en worden opgetrokken van dek tot dek, met de volgende uitzonderingen: 

.1 wanneer aan beide zijden van het schot doorlopende plafondbeschietingen van klasse „B” worden aangebracht moet het gedeelte van het schot achter het doorlopende plafond of de doorlopende beschieting van materiaal zijn waarvan dikte en samenstelling aanvaardbaar zijn bij de constructie van schotten van klasse „B”, doch die slechts aan de normen voor brandwerendheid van klasse „B” behoeven te voldoen voor zover zulks naar de mening van de Administratie redelijk en uitvoerbaar is; en  

.2 op een schip dat beveiligd wordt door een automatisch sprinklersysteem dat voldoet aan het bepaalde in de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen, mogen de schotten voor gangen eindigen bij een plafond in de gang mits dergelijke schotten en plafonds aan de norm voor klasse „B” voldoen conform de vereisten van paragraaf 2.2.4. Alle deuren en kozijnen in zulke schotten moeten van onbrandbaar materiaal zijn en moeten dezelfde brandwerendheid bezitten als het schot waarin zij zijn aangebracht.    

2.2.2.3 Schotten die klasse „B”-schotten behoren te zijn, behalve schotten van gangen als voorgeschreven in paragraaf 2.2.2.2, moe-ten worden opgetrokken van dek tot dek, tot aan de huid of tot aan andere scheidingswanden. Wanneer een schot dat ten minste dezelfde brandwerendheid bezit als het aangrenzende schot, aan beide zijden wordt voorzien van een plafond of beschieting van klasse „B”, mag het schot evenwel eindigen bij het doorlopende plafond of de doorlopende beschieting.    

2.2.3 Brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken op schepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren 

2.2.3.1 Behalve dat moet worden voldaan aan de specifieke bepalingen voor brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken op passagiersschepen, moet de brandwerendheid van alle schotten en dekken ten minste zijn zoals voorgeschreven in de tabellen 9.1 en 9.2. Indien op grond van een bijzondere structurele indeling van het schip moeilijkheden worden ondervonden bij de bepaling uit de tabellen van de minimumwaarde voor de brandwerendheid voor schotten, moeten zulke waarden ten genoegen van de Administratie worden bepaald.  

2.2.3.2 De toepassing van de tabellen wordt geregeld door de volgende bepalingen: 

.1 Tabel 9.1 is van toepassing op schotten die geen verticale hoofdsecties of horizontale secties begrenzen. Tabel 9.2 is van toepassing op dekken die verticale hoofdsecties niet trapsgewijs doen verspringen of die geen horizontale secties begrenzen;  

.2 Ter bepaling van de passende normen voor de brandwerendheid die moeten worden toegepast voor de scheidingswanden tussen aan elkaar grenzende ruimten, zijn deze ruimten ingedeeld op grond van hun brandrisico als aangegeven in onderstaande categorieën (1) t/m (14). Indien de inhoud en het gebruik van een dergelijke ruimte zodanig zijn dat er twijfel bestaat omtrent de indeling ervan uit hoofde van dit voorschrift, of indien het mogelijk is twee of meer indelingen aan een ruimte toe te wijzen, moet deze worden beschouwd als een ruimte binnen de desbetreffende categorie met de strengste eisen omtrent de scheidingswanden. Kleinere, ingesloten ruimten binnen een ruimte die minder dan 30% met die ruimte in verbinding staande openingen hebben, worden aangemerkt als aparte ruimten. De brandwerendheid van de scheidingswanden en -dekken van dergelijke kleinere ruimten moet conform de vereisten van de tabellen 9.1 en 9.2 zijn. De titel van elke categorie moet meer als omschrijving dan als beperking worden beschouwd. Het tussen haken geplaatste nummer dat aan elke categorie voorafgaat, verwijst naar het desbetreffende kolom- of rijnummer in de tabellen.

Noot: Van toepassing op de tabellen 9.1 en 9.2. <sup>a</sup> Indien aan elkaar grenzende ruimten onder dezelfde nummercategorie vallen en in de tabellen zijn voorzien van de letter a, behoeft er geen schot of dek tussen dergelijke ruimten te worden aangebracht wanneer de Administratie dit onnodig acht. In categorie (12) bijvoorbeeld behoeft geen schot te worden geëist tussen een kombuis en de daarbij behorende pantry’s, mits de schotten en de dekken van de pantry’s geen afbreuk doen aan de brandwerendheid van de begrenzingswanden van kombuizen. Er is evenwel een schot vereist tussen een kombuis en een machineruimte, zelfs wanneer beide ruimten onder categorie (12) vallen. <sup>b</sup> De scheepszijde, tot aan de waterlijn bij de geringste diepgang in zeewater, alsook de bovenbouw en dekhuiszijden gelegen onder en grenzend aan de inschepingsplaatsen waar reddingvlotten en ontsnappingsglijbanen kunnen worden verminderd tot „A-30”. <sup>c</sup> Waar openbare toiletten geheel binnen de ingesloten trapruimte zijn geplaatst, kan het schot van het openbare toilet binnen het trappenhuis brandwerendheid klasse „B” hebben. <sup>d</sup> Wanneer zich ruimten van de categorieÙn (6), (7), (8) en (9) geheel binnen de buitenste rand van de verzamelplaatsen bevinden, mogen de schotten van deze ruimten brandwerendheidsklasse „B-0” hebben. Controleposities voor geluids-, beeld- en lichtinstallaties kunnen worden beschouwd als onderdeel van de verzamelplaats.  

2.2.3.3 Doorlopende plafonds of beschietingen van klasse „B” kunnen tezamen met de desbetreffende dekken of schotten worden aanvaard als een volledige of gedeeltelijke bijdrage tot de vereiste isolatie en brandwerendheid van een afscheiding.  

2.2.3.4 Constructie en inrichting van sauna’s 

2.2.3.4.1 De omtrek van de sauna moet met scheidingswanden van klasse „A” zijn uitgevoerd en kan kleedkamers, douches en toiletten omvatten. De sauna moet volgens de A-60-norm worden geïsoleerd van andere ruimten, behoudens die welke zich binnen de omtrek bevinden en ruimten van de categorieën (5), (9) en (10).  

2.2.3.4.2 Badkamers die rechtstreeks toegang tot sauna’s verschaffen, mogen worden aangemerkt als onderdeel ervan. In dergelijke gevallen behoeft de deur tussen de sauna en de badkamer niet te voldoen aan de brandveiligheidsvereisten.  

2.2.3.4.3 De traditionele houten beschietingen op schotten en plafonds zijn in sauna’s toegestaan. Het plafond boven de kachel moet worden voorzien van een onbrandbare plaat met een luchtgat van ten minste 30 mm. De afstand van de hete oppervlakken tot brandbare materialen moet ten minste 500 mm bedragen of de brandbare materialen moeten worden beveiligd (bijv. onbrandbare plaat met een luchtgat van ten minste 30 mm).  

2.2.3.4.4 De traditionele houten banken mogen in sauna’s worden gebruikt.  

2.2.3.4.5 De saunadeuren moeten door middel van duwen naar buiten openen.

*Noten:* Toe te passen op zowel de tabel 9.3 als 9.4, al naar gelang. a Ter verduidelijking van hetgeen van toepassing is, zie de paragrafen 2.2.2 en 2.2.5. b. Wanneer ruimten in dezelfde nummercategorie vallen en zijn voorzien van de letter b, is een schot of een dek van de classificaties vermeld in de tabellen uitsluitend vereist wanneer de aan elkaar grenzende ruimten ieder voor een ander doel zijn bestemd (zoals in categorie (9)). Wanneer twee kombuizen aan elkaar grenzen, worden aan het tussenschot geen eisen gesteld, maar wanneer een kombuis grenst aan een verfhut, is een schot van klasse „A-0” vereist. c. Schotten die het stuurhuis en de kaartenkamer van elkaar scheiden, mogen vallen in klasse „B-0”. d. Zie de paragrafen 2.2.4.2.3 en 2.2.4.2.4. e. Voor de toepassing van paragraaf 2.2.1.1.2, moeten „B-0” en „C”, waar voorkomend in tabel 9.3, worden gelezen als „A-O”. f. Er behoeft geen brandisolatie te worden aangebracht indien de machineruimte vallend onder categorie (7) naar het oordeel van de Administratie weinig of in het geheel niet brandgevaarlijk is. * Waar in de tabellen een sterretje staat, moet het scheidingsschot of -dek zijn vervaardigd van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal, maar behoeft het niet te voldoen aan de norm voor klasse „A”. Wanneer een dek evenwel wordt doorboord voor het doorvoeren van elektrische kabels, pijpen en ventilatiekanalen, moeten deze doorboringen, behoudens in een ruimte van categorie (10), vlam- en rookdicht worden gemaakt. Schotten tussen controlekamers (noodgeneratoren) en open dekken mogen luchtinlaatopeningen hebben zonder voorziening om deze te sluiten, tenzij een vaste brandblusinstallatie met verstikkend gas is aangebracht. {nieuw} Voor de toepassing van paragraaf 2.2.1.1.2, moet een sterretje, wanneer dit voorkomt in tabel 9.4, behalve voor de categorieën (8) en (10), worden gelezen als „A-0”.    

2.2.5 Beveiliging van trappen en liften in ruimten voor accommodatie 

2.2.5.1 Trappen moeten in een ruimte zijn ondergebracht die omgeven is door schotten van klasse „A”. Alle openingen in deze schotten moeten van doeltreffende afsluitmiddelen zijn voorzien, met de volgende uitzonderingen: 

.1 Een trap die slechts twee dekken bedient, behoeft niet in een dergelijke ingesloten ruimte te zijn ondergebracht indien de brandwerendheid van het dek wordt behouden door het aanbrengen van doelmatige schotten of zelfsluitende deuren in één van de ruimten die de trap verbindt. Wanneer een trap in één van de ruimten die hij verbindt gesloten is, moet de ingesloten trapruimte beveiligd zijn overeenkomstig de tabellen voor dekken in paragraaf 2.2.3 of 2.2.4; en  

.2 Een trap die uitkomt in een ruimte voor algemeen gebruik, behoeft ter plaatse niet door dergelijke schotten omgeven te zijn, indien hij zich geheel binnen de ruimte bevindt.    

2.2.5.2 Liftschachten moeten zodanig zijn aangebracht dat zij het doordringen van rook en vlammen van het ene dek naar het andere beletten. Zij moeten zijn voorzien van afsluitmiddelen waarmee de trek en de rookverspreiding onder controle kunnen worden gehouden. Machines voor liften die zich binnen ingesloten trapruimten bevinden moeten in een aparte ruimte worden ondergebracht, omgeven door stalen scheidingswanden, met dien verstande dat smalle doorgangen voor liftkabels zijn toegestaan. Liften die uitkomen op ruimten anders dan gangen, ruimten bestemd voor algemeen gebruik, ruimten van bijzondere aard, trappen en externe ruimten, mogen niet uitkomen op trappen die onderdeel van een vluchtroute vormen.    

2.2.6  *Inrichting van hutbalkons*  Op passagiersschepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2008 moeten niet-lastdragende gedeeltelijke schotten die aangrenzende hutbalkons scheiden, ten behoeve van brandbestrijding door de bemanning van beide zijden kunnen worden geopend.    

2.3 Vrachtschepen, met uitzondering van tankschepen 

2.3.1 Beveiligingsmethoden in ruimten voor accommodatie 

2.3.1.1 In ruimten voor accommodatie, dienstruimten en controlestations moet één van de volgende beveiligingsmethoden worden toegepast: 

.1 Methode IC De constructie van inwendige scheidingswanden door middel van schotten van klasse „B” of „C” van onbrandbaar materiaal, in het algemeen zonder dat een automatische sprinkler-, branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie wordt aangebracht in de ruimten voor accommodatie en de dienstruimten, behalve zoals vereist krachtens voorschrift 7.5.5.1; of  

.2 Methode IIC Het installeren van een automatische sprinkler-, branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie zoals vereist krachtens voorschrift 7.5.5.2 voor het detecteren en blussen van brand in alle ruimten waarin het ontstaan van brand zou kunnen worden verwacht, waarbij in het algemeen geen beperking geldt ten aanzien van het type van de inwendige scheidingsschotten; of  

.3 Methode IIIC Het installeren in ruimten waarin het ontstaan van brand zou kunnen worden verwacht van een vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie, zoals vereist krachtens voorschrift 7.5.5.3, waarbij in het algemeen geen beperking geldt ten aanzien van het type van de inwendige scheidingsschotten met dien verstande dat een ruimte of ruimten voor accommodatie die wordt of worden begrensd door een schot van klasse „A” of „B” in geen geval een oppervlakte van meer dan 50 m <sup>2</sup> mag of mogen hebben. De Administratie kan overwegen voor ruimten voor algemeen gebruik een grotere oppervlakte toe te staan.    

2.3.1.2 Bij alle drie in paragraaf 2.3.1.1 aangegeven methoden zijn de eisen ten aanzien van het gebruik van onbrandbare materialen voor de bouw en de isolatie van begrenzingsschotten van machineruimten, controlestations, dienstruimten enzovoorts en de beveiliging van bovengenoemde ingesloten trapruimten en gangen gelijk.    

2.3.2 Schotten binnen ruimten voor accommodatie 

2.3.2.1 Schotten die klasse „B”-schotten behoren te zijn, moeten worden opgetrokken van dek tot dek, tot aan de huid of tot aan andere scheidingswanden. Wanneer het schot aan beide zijden wordt voorzien van een plafond of beschieting van klasse „B”, mag het schot evenwel eindigen bij het doorlopende plafond of de doorlopende beschieting.  

2.3.2.2 Methode IC Schotten die krachtens dit of andere voorschriften voor vrachtschepen niet van klasse „A” of „B” behoeven te zijn, moeten ten minste van klasse „C” zijn.  

2.3.2.3 Methode IIC Er bestaat geen beperking ten aanzien van de constructie van schotten die krachtens dit voorschrift of krachtens andere voorschriften voor vrachtschepen niet van klasse „A” of „B” behoeven te zijn, behalve in individuele gevallen, waarin in overeenstemming met tabel 9.5 schotten van klasse „C” worden vereist.  

2.3.2.4 Methode IIIC Er bestaat geen beperking ten aanzien van de constructie van schot-ten die op vrachtschepen niet van klasse „A” of „B” behoeven te zijn, met dien verstande dat de oppervlakte van een ruimte of ruimten voor accommodatie begrensd door doorlopende schotten van klasse „A” of „B” in geen geval meer dan 50 m <sup>2</sup> mag bedragen behalve in individuele gevallen, waarin in overeenstemming met tabel 9.5 schotten van klasse „C” worden vereist. De Administratie kan overwegen voor ruimten voor algemeen gebruik een grotere oppervlakte toe te staan.    

2.3.3 Brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken 

2.3.3.1 Behalve dat moet worden voldaan aan de specifieke bepalingen voor brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken op vrachtschepen, moet de brandwerendheid van alle schotten en dekken ten minste zijn zoals voorgeschreven in de tabellen 9.5 en 9.6.  

2.3.3.2 De toepassing van de tabellen wordt geregeld door de volgende bepalingen: 

.1 Tabellen 9.5 en 9.6 zijn respectievelijk van toepassing op schotten en dekken die aan elkaar grenzende ruimten scheiden;  

.2 Ter bepaling van de passende normen voor de brandwerendheid die moeten worden toegepast voor de scheidingswanden tussen aan elkaar grenzende ruimten, zijn deze ruimten ingedeeld op grond van hun brandrisico als aangegeven in onderstaande categorieën (1) t/m (11). Indien de inhoud en het gebruik van een dergelijke ruimte zodanig zijn dat er twijfel bestaat omtrent de indeling ervan uit hoofde van dit voorschrift, of indien het mogelijk is twee of meer indelingen aan een ruimte toe te wijzen, moet deze worden beschouwd als een ruimte binnen de desbetreffende categorie met de strengste eisen omtrent de scheidingswanden. Kleinere, ingesloten ruimten binnen een ruimte die minder dan 30% met die ruimte in verbinding staande openingen hebben, worden aangemerkt als aparte ruimten. De brandwerendheid van de afscheidingswanden en -dekken van dergelijke kleinere ruimten moet conform de vereisten van de tabellen 9.5 en 9.6 zijn. De titel van elke categorie moet meer als omschrijving dan als beperking worden beschouwd. Het tussen haken geplaatste nummer dat elke categorie voorafgaat, verwijst naar het desbetreffende kolom- of rijnummer in de tabellen;

Voetnoten: Van toepassing op de tabellen 9.5 tot en met 9.6, waar deze staan aangegeven. a. Bij beveiliging tegen brand volgens methoden IIC en IIIC worden geen bijzondere eisen gesteld ten aanzien van schotten. b. In geval van methode IIIC moeten schotten van klasse „B-0” worden aangebracht tussen ruimten of groepen van ruimten met een oppervlakte van 50 m <sup>2</sup> of meer. c. Ter verduidelijking van hetgeen van toepassing is, zie de paragrafen 2.3.2 en 2.3.4. d. Wanneer ruimten in dezelfde nummercategorie vallen en zijn voorzien van de letter d, is een schot of een dek van de classificaties vermeld in de tabellen uitsluitend vereist wanneer de aan elkaar grenzende ruimten ieder voor een ander doel zijn bestemd (zoals in categorie (9)). Wanneer twee kombuizen aan elkaar grenzen, worden aan het tussenschot geen eisen gesteld, maar wanneer een kombuis grenst aan een verfhut, is een schot van klasse „A-0” vereist. e. Schotten die het stuurhuis, de kaartenkamer en de radiohut van elkaar scheiden, mogen van klasse „B-0” zijn. f. Klasse „A-0” kan worden gebruikt indien het niet in de bedoeling ligt gevaarlijke stoffen te vervoeren, of indien zulke stoffen niet worden gestuwd op een afstand van minder dan 3 m, horizontaal gemeten, vanaf zulke schotten. g. Op laadruimten die zijn bestemd voor het vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen, is voorschrift 19.3.8 van toepassing. h. Indien naar het oordeel van de Administratie weinig of geen brandgevaar bestaat, moeten schotten en dekken die ro-ro-ruimten scheiden redelijk gasdicht kunnen worden gesloten en moeten zulke schotten, voor zover dit redelijk uitvoerbaar is, een brandwerendheid van klasse „A” hebben. i. Er behoeft geen brandisolatie te worden aangebracht indien de machineruimte vallend onder categorie (7) naar het oordeel van de Administratie weinig of in het geheel niet brandgevaarlijk is. * Waar in de tabellen een sterretje staat, moet het scheidingsschot of -dek zijn vervaardigd van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal, maar behoeft het niet te voldoen aan de norm voor klasse „A”. Wanneer een dek evenwel wordt doorboord voor het doorvoeren van elektrische kabels, pijpen en ventilatiekanalen, moeten deze doorboringen, behoudens in een open dek, vlam- en rookdicht worden gemaakt. Schotten tussen controlekamers (noodgeneratoren) en open dekken mogen luchtinlaatopeningen hebben zonder voorziening om deze te sluiten, tenzij een vaste brandblusinstallatie met verstikkende gas is aangebracht.  

2.3.3.3 Doorlopende plafonds of beschietingen van klasse „B” kunnen tezamen met de desbetreffende dekken of schotten worden aanvaard als een volledige of gedeeltelijke bijdrage tot de vereiste isolatie en brandwerendheid van een afscheiding.  

2.3.3.4 De buitenste scheidingswanden die krachtens voorschrift 11.2 moeten zijn vervaardigd van staal of een ander gelijkwaardig materiaal, mogen zijn doorboord voor het aanbrengen van ramen en patrijspoorten, mits niet wordt vereist dat zulke scheidingswanden op vrachtschepen een brandwerendheid van klasse „A” hebben. Evenzo mogen in zulke scheidingswanden die geen brandwerendheid van klasse „A” behoeven te hebben, deuren zijn vervaardigd van materialen die ten genoegen van de Administratie zijn.  

2.3.3.5 Sauna’s moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 2.2.3.4.    

2.3.4 Beveiliging van trappen en liftschachten in ruimten voor accommodatie, dienstruimten en controlestations 

2.3.4.1 Trappen die door slechts één dek voeren, moeten minimaal op één niveau worden beveiligd door schotten van ten minste klasse „B-0” en door zelfsluitende deuren. Liften die door slechts één dek voeren moeten zijn omgeven door schotten van klasse „A-0” met stalen deuren op beide niveaus. Trappen en liftschachten die door meer dan één dek voeren moeten op alle niveaus zijn omgeven door schotten van ten minste klasse „A-0” en moeten worden beveiligd door zelfsluitende deuren.  

2.3.4.2 Op schepen met accommodatie voor 12 personen of minder, waarop trappen door méér dan één dek voeren en waarop op ieder niveau waar zich ruimten voor accommodatie bevinden ten minste twee vluchtwegen zijn die rechtstreeks op het open dek uitkomen, is het toegestaan daar waar in paragraaf 1 klasse „A-0” wordt vereist, slechts klasse „B-0” te verlangen.      

2.4 Tankschepen 

2.4.1 Toepassing Ten aanzien van tankschepen mag uitsluitend methode IC, als omschreven in paragraaf 2.3.1.1 worden gebruikt.  

2.4.2 Brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken 

2.4.2.1 Wat betreft de brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken behoeft niet aan het bepaalde in paragraaf 2.3 te worden voldaan; in plaats daarvan moet, in aanvulling op de specifieke bepalingen voor brandwerendheid van schotten en dekken op tankschepen, ten minste worden voldaan aan de vereisten van de tabellen 9.7 en 9.8.  

2.4.2.2 De toepassing van de tabellen wordt geregeld door de volgende bepalingen: 

.1 Tabellen 9.7 en 9.8 zijn respectievelijk van toepassing op schotten en dekken die aan elkaar grenzende ruimten scheiden;  

.2 Ter bepaling van de passende normen voor de brandwerendheid die moeten worden toegepast voor de scheidingswanden tussen aan elkaar grenzende ruimten, zijn deze ruimten ingedeeld op grond van hun brandrisico als aangegeven in onderstaande categorieën (1) t/m (10). Indien de inhoud en het gebruik van een dergelijke ruimte zodanig zijn dat er twijfel bestaat omtrent de indeling ervan uit hoofde van dit voorschrift, of indien het mogelijk is twee of meer indelingen aan een ruimte toe te wijzen, moet deze worden beschouwd als een ruimte binnen de desbetreffende categorie met de strengste eisen omtrent de scheidingswanden. Kleinere, ingesloten gedeelten binnen een ruimte die minder dan 30% met die ruimte in verbinding staande openingen hebben, worden aangemerkt als aparte gedeelten. De brandwerendheid van de afscheidingswanden en -dekken van dergelijke kleinere ruimten moet conform de vereisten van de tabellen 9.7 en 9.8 zijn. De titel van elke categorie moet meer als omschrijving dan als beperking worden beschouwd. Het tussen haken geplaatste nummer dat aan elke categorie voorafgaat, verwijst naar het desbetreffende kolom- of rijnummer in de tabellen; 

(1) Controlestations  

Ruimten waarin de noodkrachtbron en de noodverlichtingsvoorzieningen zijn ondergebracht.  

Stuurhuis en kaartenkamer.

Noten: Van toepassing op de tabellen 9.7 tot en met 9.8, waar deze staan aangegeven. a. Ter verduidelijking van hetgeen van toepassing is, zie de paragrafen 2.3.2 en 2.3.4. b. Wanneer ruimten in dezelfde nummercategorie vallen en zijn voorzien van de letter b, is een schot of een dek van de classificaties vermeld in de tabellen uitsluitend vereist wanneer de aan elkaar grenzende ruimten ieder voor een ander doel zijn bestemd (zoals in categorie (9)). Wanneer twee kombuizen aan elkaar grenzen, worden aan het tussenschot geen eisen gesteld, maar wanneer een kombuis grenst aan een verfhut, is een schot van klasse „A-0” vereist. c. Schotten die het stuurhuis, de kaartenkamer en de radiohut van elkaar scheiden, mogen van klasse „B-0” zijn. d. In schotten en dekken tussen ladingpompkamers en machineruimten van categorie A mogen doorboringen van ladingpompassen, voorzien van pakkingbussen, dan wel soortgelijke van pakkingbussen voorziene doorboringen zijn aangebracht, mits er ter plaatse van de schotten of het dek gasdichte afsluitingen met doeltreffende smering, of andere middelen waardoor de blijvende gasdichtheid wordt verzekerd zijn aangebracht. e. Er behoeft geen brandisolatie te worden aangebracht indien de machineruimte vallend onder categorie (7) naar het oordeel van de Administratie weinig of in het geheel niet brandgevaarlijk is. *Waar in de tabel een sterretje staat, moet het scheidingsschot of -dek zijn vervaardigd van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal, maar behoeft het niet te voldoen aan de norm voor klasse „A”. Wanneer een dek evenwel wordt doorboord voor het doorvoeren van elektrische kabels, pijpen en ventilatiekanalen, moeten deze doorboringen, behoudens in een open dek, vlam- en rookdicht worden gemaakt. Schotten tussen controlekamers (noodgeneratoren) en open dekken mogen luchtinlaatopeningen hebben zonder voorziening om deze te sluiten, tenzij een vaste brandblusinstallatie met verstikkend gas is aangebracht.        

3 Doorboringen in brandwerende schotten en voorkoming van de geleiding van warmte 

3.1 Wanneer schotten van klasse „A” worden doorboord, moeten deze doorboringen worden beproefd in overeenstemming met de Code inzake beproevingsprocedures voor brandwerendheid, onverminderd de bepalingen van paragraaf 4.1.1.5. Ten aanzien van ventilatiekanalen zijn de paragrafen 7.1.2 en 7.3.1. van toepassing. Wanneer een pijpdoorboring is vervaardigd van staal of gelijkwaardig materiaal met een dikte van 3 mm of meer en een lengte van ten minste 900 mm (bij voorkeur 450 mm aan elke zijde van het schot), en geen openingen heeft, is beproeving niet vereist. Dergelijke doorboringen moeten deugdelijk worden geïsoleerd door middel van aanvulling van de isolatie op hetzelfde niveau van het schot.  

3.2 Wanneer schotten van klasse „B” worden doorboord voor het doorvoeren van elektrische kabels, pijpen, schachten, kanalen, enzovoorts of voor het aanbrengen van uitlaten van het ventilatiesysteem, verlichtingsarmaturen en soortgelijke inrichtingen, moeten, onverminderd de bepalingen van paragraaf 7.3.2, voorzieningen worden getroffen om te verzekeren dat de brandwerendheid hierdoor niet vermindert. Pijpen, anders dan van staal of koper, die door schotten van klasse „B” worden gevoerd, moeten worden beveiligd door middel van: 

.1 een aan een brandbeproeving onderworpen doorboringsvoorziening die geschikt is voor de brandwerendheid van het desbetreffende schot en voor het type pijp dat wordt gebruikt; of  

.2 een stalen koker met een dikte van ten minste 1,8 mm en een lengte van ten minste 900 mm voor pijpdiameters van 150 mm of meer, en ten minste 600 mm voor pijpdiameters van minder dan 150 mm (bij voorkeur gelijk verdeeld over beide zijden van het schot). De pijp moet aan het uiteinde van de koker worden bevestigd door middel van flenzen en koppelingen; of de vrije ruimte tussen de koker en de pijp mag niet groter zijn dan 2,5 mm; of de vrije ruimte tussen de pijp en de koker moet worden afgedicht door middel van onbrandbaar materiaal of ander geschikt materiaal.    

3.3 Niet geïsoleerde metalen pijpen die schotten van klasse „A” of „B” doorboren, moeten zijn vervaardigd van materialen die een smelttemperatuur hebben boven de 950 °C ten aanzien van schotten van klasse „A-0” en 850 °C ten aanzien van schotten van klasse „B-0”.  

3.4 Bij de goedkeuring van specifieke aspecten van de structurele brandbeveiliging moet de Administratie acht slaan op het gevaar van geleiding van warmte bij kruisingen en eindpunten van de vereiste brandschotten. Bij stalen en aluminium constructies moet de isolatie van een dek of schot ten minste 450 mm voorbij de doorboring, de kruising of het eindpunt worden doorgetrokken. Indien een ruimte is gescheiden door middel van een dek of schot dat voldoet aan de norm voor klasse „A” met verschillende isolatiewaarden, moet de isolatie van de hogere waarde ten minste 450 mm doorlopen op het dek of schot dat is voorzien van isolatie van de lagere waarde.    

4 Beveiliging van openingen in brandwerende schotten 

4.1 Openingen in schotten en dekken op passagiersschepen 

4.1.1 Openingen in schotten van klasse „A” 

4.1.1.1 Openingen moeten zijn voorzien van vast aangebrachte sluitingsmiddelen die ten minste even doeltreffend zijn voor het weren van brand als de schotten waarin zij voorkomen, met uitzondering van luiken tussen ruimten voor lading, ruimten van bijzondere aard, ruimten voor voorraden en bagage en tussen deze ruimten en het open dek.  

4.1.1.2 De constructie van deuren en deurkozijnen in schotten van klasse „A” en de middelen die deze gesloten houden, moeten even doeltreffend zijn voor het weren van brand en van het doordringen van rook en vlammen als de schotten waarin zij zijn aangebracht; een en ander moet worden vastgesteld in overeenstemming met de Code inzake beproevingsprocedures voor brandwerendheid. Zulke deuren en deurkozijnen moeten zijn geconstrueerd van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal. Goedgekeurde deuren waarbij de drempel geen deel uitmaakt van het kozijn,die op of na 1 juli 2010 worden geïnstalleerd, worden zodanig geplaatst dat de ruimte onder de deur ten hoogste 12 mm bedraagt. Een onbrandbare drempel wordt zodanig onder de deur geplaatst dat vloerbedekking niet tot onder de gesloten deur reikt.  

4.1.1.3 Waterdichte deuren behoeven niet te zijn geïsoleerd.

### Voorschrift  10  

####Brandbestrijding

1 Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is een brand te bestrijden en onverwijld te blussen in de ruimte waarin deze is ontstaan. Hiertoe moet aan de volgende functionele vereisten worden voldaan: 

.1 er moeten vaste brandblusinstallaties worden aangebracht, met voldoende aandacht voor de kans op branduitbreiding in de beveiligde ruimten; en  

.2 brandblusmiddelen moeten bedrijfsklaar beschikbaar zijn.    

2 Watervoorzieningssystemen Schepen moeten zijn voorzien van brandbluspompen, hoofdbrandblusleidingen, brandkranen en brandslangen, die voldoen aan de vereisten van dit voorschrift. 

2.1 Hoofdbrandblusleidingen en brandkranen 

2.1.1 Algemeen De hoofdbrandblusleidingen en brandkranen mogen, tenzij afdoende beveiligd, niet worden vervaardigd van materialen die niet hittebestendig zijn. Brandblusleidingen en brandkranen moeten zodanig zijn geplaatst dat de brandslangen gemakkelijk daaraan kunnen worden gekoppeld. De leidingen en brandkranen moeten zodanig zijn aangebracht dat zij niet kunnen bevriezen. Ten behoeve van de hoofdbrandblusleidingen moet worden gezorgd voor geschikte afwateringsvoorzieningen. Op alle hoofdbrandblusleidingen op open dekken die voor andere doeleinden dan brandbestrijding worden gebruikt, moeten afsluiters zijn aangebracht. Op schepen die deklading kunnen vervoeren, moet de plaats van de brandkranen zodanig zijn dat zij altijd gemakkelijk bereikbaar zijn en de leidingen moeten, zoveel als praktisch mogelijk, zodanig zijn aangelegd dat het gevaar voor beschadiging door dergelijke lading wordt vermeden.  

2.1.2 Onmiddellijke beschikbaarheid van wateraanvoer De voorzieningen voor de onmiddellijke beschikbaarheid van wateraanvoer moeten de volgende zijn: 

.1 op passagiersschepen: 

.1.1 met een brutotonnage van 1000 ton en meer moet ten minste één doeltreffende waterstraal onmiddellijk beschikbaar zijn vanuit ongeacht welke brandkraan binnenin het schip en moet de waterstroom worden verzekerd door het automatisch in bedrijf komen van één vereiste brandbluspomp;  

.1.2 met een brutotonnage van minder dan 1000 ton, door automatische inschakeling van ten minste één brandbluspomp of door inschakeling op afstand vanaf de navigatiebrug van ten minste één brandbluspomp. Indien de pomp automatisch in werking wordt gesteld of indien de onderste afsluiter niet kan worden geopend vanaf het punt waarop de pomp op afstand in werking wordt gesteld, moet de onderste afsluiter altijd geopend blijven; en  

.1.3 die zijn uitgerust met een machineruimte die periodiek zonder toezicht is overeenkomstig voorschrift II-1/54, moet de Administratie voor dergelijke ruimten voorzieningen vaststellen voor vast aangebrachte waterbrandblusvoorzieningen, die gelijkwaardig zijn aan die welke worden vereist voor machineruimten met doorlopende wachtbezetting.    

.2 op vrachtschepen: 

.2.1 ten genoegen van de Administratie; en  

.2.2 met een machineruimte die periodiek zonder toezicht is of waarin slechts één persoon op wacht wordt vereist, moet onmiddellijk water onder passende druk kunnen worden geleverd vanuit het systeem van de hoofdbrandblusleiding, hetzij door het op afstand in werking stellen van één van de daartoe uitgeruste hoofdbrandbluspompen vanaf de navigatiebrug en, indien aanwezig, vanaf het controlestation voor de brandmelding, hetzij door het permanent handhaven van druk in het hoofdbrandblussysteem via een van de hoofdbrandbluspompen, met dien verstande dat de Administratie vrijstelling van deze eis kan verlenen voor vrachtschepen met een brutotonnage van minder dan 1600 ton, indien de voorziening voor het in werking stellen van de brandbluspomp zich in de machineruimte op een gemakkelijk toegankelijke plaats bevindt:      

2.1.3 Diameter van hoofdbrandblusleidingen De diameter van de hoofdbrandblusleiding en van de aftakkingen daarvan moet voldoende zijn voor een doelmatige verwerking van het maximaal voorgeschreven debiet van twee gelijktijdig werkende brandbluspompen, doch op vrachtschepen behoeft deze diameter slechts voldoende te zijn voor een debiet van niet meer dan 140 m <sup>3</sup> /u.  

2.1.4 Afsluiters en ontlastkleppen 

2.1.4.1 Afsluiters die dienen om het deel van de hoofdbrandblusleiding binnen de machineruimte waarin de hoofdbrandbluspomp of -pompen zijn opgesteld, te scheiden van de rest van de hoofdbrandblusleiding, moeten worden aangebracht op een gemakkelijk bereikbare en bedienbare plaats buiten de machineruimten. De hoofdbrandblusleiding moet zodanig worden geplaatst dat wanneer de afsluiters gesloten zijn alle brandkranen op het schip, behalve die in bovengenoemde machineruimte, met water kunnen worden gevoed door een andere pomp of een noodbrandbluspomp. De noodbrandbluspomp, de zeewaterinlaatopening, alsmede de aanzuig- en toevoerleidingen en afsluitkleppen ervan moeten buiten de machineruimte worden aangebracht. Indien deze configuratie niet mogelijk is, mag de zeewaterinlaatopening in de machineruimte worden aangebracht, met dien verstande dat de afsluiter op afstand moet worden bediend vanuit een positie gelegen binnen hetzelfde compartiment als de noodbrandbluspomp en dat de aanzuigleiding zo kort moet zijn als praktisch uitvoerbaar is. Korte lengtes van aanzuig- of afvoerleidingen mogen de machineruimte binnengaan, mits deze zijn gevat in een stevige stalen behuizing, of worden geïsoleerd conform de norm voor klasse „A-60”. De leidingen moeten voldoende dikke wanden hebben, doch in geen geval minder dan 11 mm, en moeten zijn gelast, behoudens de flensverbinding naar de zeewaterinlaatklep.  

2.1.4.2 Ten behoeve van elke brandkraan moet een afsluiter zijn aangebracht, zodat elke brandslang kan worden afgekoppeld terwijl de brandbluspompen in werking zijn.  

2.1.4.3 Brandbluspompen moeten alle van ontlastkleppen worden voorzien, als zij in staat zijn een druk te leveren die de druk overtreft waarvoor de brandblusleidingen, brandkranen en brandslangen zijn ontworpen. Deze ontlastkleppen moeten op zodanige plaats zijn aangebracht en zodanig zijn afgesteld, dat een te hoge druk in enig deel van de hoofdbrandblusleiding wordt voorkomen.  

2.1.4.4 Op tankschepen moeten afsluiters zijn aangebracht in de hoofdbrandblusleiding bij het voorschot van de kampanje op een beschermde plaats, en op het tankdek, op een onderlinge afstand van niet meer dan 40 m, teneinde de goede werking van het hoofdbrandblusleidingstelsel in geval van brand of ontploffing te behouden.    

2.1.5 Aantal en plaats van de brandkranen 

2.1.5.1 Het aantal en de plaats van de brandkranen moeten zodanig zijn dat met ten minste twee stralen water, niet afkomstig uit dezelfde brandkraan, waarbij voor een van deze stralen slechts één slanglengte mag worden gebruikt, elk deel van het schip dat gedurende de vaart onder normale omstandigheden toegankelijk is voor passagiers of bemanning, bereikt kan worden, alsmede ieder deel van iedere laadruimte wanneer deze leeg is, en ook iedere ro-ro-ruimte en iedere voertuigruimte, met dien verstande echter dat in laatstgenoemd geval de beide waterstralen ieder deel van de ruimte moeten kunnen bereiken, ieder met slechts één slanglengte. Voorts moeten deze brandkranen zich bevinden nabij de toegang tot de beveiligde ruimten.  

2.1.5.2 In aanvulling op de vereisten van paragraaf 2.1.5.1 moeten passagiersschepen voldoen aan de volgende vereisten:

### Voorschrift  11  

####Structurele veiligheid

1 Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is het behouden van de structurele veiligheid van het schip ter voorkoming van het geheel of gedeeltelijk bezwijken van de scheepsstructuur als gevolg van verslapping door hitte. Hiertoe moeten bij de constructie van het schip materialen worden gebruikt die er borg voor staan dat de structurele veiligheid bij hitte niet wordt aangetast.  

2 Materiaal van de romp, opbouw, structurele schotten, dekken en dekhuizen De romp, de bovenbouw, structurele schotten, dekken en dekhuizen moeten van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal vervaardigd zijn. Voor de toepassing van de omschrijving van staal of ander gelijkwaardig materiaal zoals die is gegeven in voorschrift 3.43 moet de „brandproef die van toepassing is”, in overeenstemming zijn met de normen van brandwerendheid en voor isolatie zoals die zijn vermeld in de tabellen 9.1 tot en met 9.4. Indien bijvoorbeeld schotten, dekken of zijden en eindschotten van dekhuizen brandwerendheid „B-0” mogen hebben is de „brandproef die van toepassing is” een half uur.  

3 Constructie van aluminiumlegering Tenzij in paragraaf 2 anders wordt bepaald, gelden in gevallen waar een deel van de constructie van een aluminiumlegering is echter de volgende voorwaarden: 

.1 de isolatie van onderdelen van schotten van klasse „A” of „B” die van aluminiumlegering zijn vervaardigd, behalve van een constructie die naar het oordeel van de Administratie niet lastdragend is, moet zodanig zijn dat de temperatuur van de metalen kern van de constructie op enig moment gedurende de van toepassing zijnde standaard brandproef niet meer dan 200 °C boven de temperatuur van de omgeving stijgt; en  

.2 bijzondere aandacht moet worden geschonken aan de isolatie van onderdelen van stutten, stijlen en andere delen van de constructie die van aluminiumlegering zijn vervaardigd en die nodig zijn ter ondersteuning van de plaatsen voor de opstelling en het te water brengen van en de inscheping in reddingboten en reddingvlotten en van schotten van klasse „A” en „B” teneinde zeker te stellen: 

.2.1 dat voor zulke constructiedelen die de plaatsen van de reddingboten en de reddingvlotten en schotten van klasse „A” steunen, de grens voor de temperatuurstijging genoemd in paragraaf 3.1 aan het einde van één uur zal gelden; en  

.2.2 dat voor zulke constructiedelen die schotten van klasse „B” moeten ondersteunen, de grens voor de temperatuurstijging genoemd in paragraaf 3.1 aan het einde van een half uur zal gelden.      

4 Machineruimten van categorie A 

4.1 Kappen en schachten Kappen en schachten van machineruimten van categorie A moeten van staal en geïsoleerd zijn overeenkomstig de vereisten van de tabellen 9.5 en 9.7, naar gelang toepasselijk.  

4.2 Vloerplaten De vloerplaten van normale gangpaden in machineruimten van categorie A moeten van staal zijn vervaardigd.    

5 Materialen van voorzieningen aan de buitenzijde Materialen die gemakkelijk onbruikbaar worden door warmte, mogen niet worden gebruikt voor spuipijpen, sanitaire uitlaten en andere uitlaten, die dichtbij de lastlijn zijn gelegen en waarvan smelten, in geval van brand, gevaar voor instromen van water zou opleveren.  

6 Beveiliging van ladingtankconstructies tegen overdruk of onderdruk op tankschepen 

6.1 Algemeen De ontluchtingsvoorzieningen moeten zodanig zijn ontworpen en functioneren dat wordt verzekerd dat noch een overdruk noch een onderdruk in de ladingtanks optreedt die de waarden overschrijdt waarop de tanks zijn ontworpen en moeten voorzien in: 

.1 de doorstroming van de kleine hoeveelheden damp, lucht of inertgasmengsels die wordt veroorzaakt door temperatuurschommelingen in een ladingtank, welke in alle gevallen moet plaats vinden via speciale kleppen die zowel overdruk als onderdruk kunnen corrigeren;  

.2 de doorstroming van grote hoeveelheden damp, lucht of inertgasmengsels gedurende het laden en ballasten of gedurende het lossen.    

6.2 Openingen voor kleine stroom bij temperatuurschommelingen De krachtens paragraaf 6.1.1 vereiste openingen voor het aflaten van overdruk moeten: 

.1 zich zo hoog mogelijk boven het ladingtankdek bevinden, opdat de brandbare dampen zich zoveel mogelijk kunnen verspreiden, maar in geen geval op minder dan 2 m hoogte boven het ladingtankdek; en  

.2 zijn aangebracht op zo groot mogelijke afstand, maar op niet minder dan 5 m vanaf de dichtstbijzijnde luchtinlaten en openingen naar omsloten ruimten die een bron van ontsteking bevatten en vanaf machines en uitrusting aan dek die een risico voor ontsteking kunnen opleveren. Openingen in ankerspillen en kettingkisten vormen een risico voor ontsteking.    

6.3 Veiligheidsmaatregelen in ladingtanks 

6.3.1 Preventieve maatregelen tegen het stijgen van vloeistoffen in het ontluchtingssysteem Er moeten voorzieningen zijn getroffen om te voorkomen dat vloeistof in het ontluchtingssysteem zou kunnen stijgen tot een hoger niveau dan dat behorende bij de ontwerpdruk van de ladingtanks. Hiertoe moeten alarmen voor een hoog vloeistofniveau of systemen die overvloeien van ladingtanks kunnen voorkomen, dan wel andere gelijkwaardige middelen worden aangebracht, en tevens moet worden zorggedragen voor onafhankelijke peilinrichtingen en moeten vaste procedures worden gevolgd voor het beladen van ladingtanks. Voor de toepassing van dit voorschrift worden lekkleppen niet gelijkgesteld met een overvloeisysteem.  

6.3.2 Secundaire voorziening voor de ontlasting van onderdruk of overdruk Er dient een secundaire voorziening voor volledige ontlasting van damp, lucht of inertgasmengsels te worden aangebracht ter voorkoming van overdruk of onderdruk in geval van storing van de in 6.1.2 genoemde voorzieningen. Als alternatief mogen druksensoren worden geïnstalleerd in iedere tank die wordt beschermd door de in paragraaf 6.1.2 vereiste voorziening met een monitoringsysteem in de ladingcontrolekamer van het schip of de plaats vanwaar ladingoperaties normaliter worden uitgevoerd. Deze monitoringapparatuur moet ook zijn voorzien van een alarmfaciliteit die wordt geactiveerd bij detectie van omstandigheden van over- of onderdruk binnen een tank.  

6.3.3 Omloopleidingen in hoofdontluchtingsleidingen De krachtens paragraaf 6.1.1 vereiste kleppen die zowel overdruk als onderdruk kunnen corrigeren kunnen zijn voorzien van een omloopleiding, wanneer zij zich bevinden in een hoofdontluchtingsleiding of in een stijgleiding in de mast. Wanneer zo’n voorziening is aangebracht, moeten er geschikte aanwijsinstrumenten aanwezig zijn die aangeven of de omloopleiding open of dicht is.  

6.3.4 Voorzieningen ter voorkoming van overdruk of onderdruk Er moeten één of meer voorzieningen zijn aangebracht ter voorkoming van overdruk of onderdruk, om te voorkomen dat de ladingtanks onderhevig zijn aan: 

.1 een overdruk, boven de beproevingsdruk van de ladingtank, indien de lading zou worden geladen bij de maximum aangegeven laadsnelheid en alle andere uitlaten gesloten blijven; en  

.2 een onderdruk van meer dan 700 mm waterkolom, indien de lading zou worden gelost terwijl de ladingpompen op maximale capaciteit draaien en de ventilatoren voor inert gas zouden uitvallen.   Deze voorzieningen moeten zijn aangebracht in de hoofdtoevoerleiding voor inert gas, tenzij zij zijn aangebracht in het ontluchtingssysteem vereist in voorschrift 4.5.3.1 of op de afzonderlijke ladingtanks. De plaats en het ontwerp van de voorzieningen moeten in overeenstemming zijn met voorschrift 4.5.3 en met paragraaf 6.

7 Aanvullende vereisten voor ro-ro-passagiersschepen 

7.1 Algemeen 

7.1.1 Ontsnappingsroutes moeten aanwezig zijn vanaf elke normaliter gebruikte ruimte op het schip tot aan een verzamelplaats. Deze ontsnappingsroutes moeten zodanig worden aangelegd dat deze de kortste weg vormen naar de verzamelplaats, en moeten worden gemarkeerd met symbolen overeenkomstig de aanbevelingen van de Organisatie.  

7.1.2 De ontsnappingsroute van hutten naar trappenhuizen moet zo direct mogelijk zijn, met een zo gering mogelijk aantal veranderingen van richting. Het mag niet nodig zijn van de ene zijde van het schip naar de andere te gaan om een ontsnappingsroute te bereiken. Het mag niet nodig zijn meer dan twee dekken omhoog of naar beneden te gaan om vanaf ongeacht welke passagiersruimte een verzamelplaats of open dek te bereiken.  

7.1.3 Buiten moeten routes zijn aangelegd van de in paragraaf 7.1.2 genoemde open dekken naar de inschepingsplaatsen van de reddingboten en -vlotten.  

7.1.4 Daar waar afgesloten ruimten grenzen aan een open dek, moeten, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, openingen van de gesloten ruimte naar het open dek kunnen worden gebruikt als nooduitgang.  

7.1.5 Ontsnappingsroutes mogen niet worden belemmerd door meubels of andere obstakels. Met uitzondering van tafels en stoelen die kunnen worden weggehaald om een open ruimte te creëren, moeten kasten en andere zware meubels in openbare ruimten en langs ontsnappingsroutes worden vastgezet ter voorkoming van schuiven bij rollen of overhellen van het schip. Vloerbedekking moet eveneens worden vastgezet. Wanneer het schip varende is, moeten de ontsnappingsroutes vrij worden gehouden van obstakels zoals schoonmaakwagens, beddengoed, bagage en dozen.    

7.2 Instructies ten behoeve van veilige ontsnapping 

7.2.1 De dekken moeten opeenvolgend worden genummerd, te beginnen met „l” op de tank top of het laagste dek. De nummers moeten duidelijk worden weergegeven onderaan de trappen en in liftportalen. De dekken mogen ook een naam hebben, maar het deknummer moet altijd worden getoond naast de naam.  

7.2.2 Eenvoudige plattegronden met de aanduiding „u bevindt zich hier”, voorzien van met pijlen aangeduide ontsnappingsroutes, moeten duidelijk zichtbaar aan de binnenzijde van elke hutdeur en in openbare ruimten worden opgehangen. Op de plattegrond moeten de ontsnappingsrichtingen worden aangegeven en de plattegrond moet overeenkomstig de positie hiervan op het schip worden bevestigd.    

7.3 Sterkte van leuningen en gangen 

7.3.1 In de gangen van de ontsnappingsroute moeten leuningen of andere middelen voor houvast worden bevestigd zodat zo veel mogelijk een continu houvast beschikbaar is naar de verzamelplaatsen en inschepingsplaatsen. Deze leuningen moeten aan weerszijden worden bevestigd in langsgangen breder dan 1,8 m en in dwarsgangen breder dan 1 m. Bijzondere aandacht moet worden besteed aan de mogelijkheid portalen, atriums en andere grote open ruimten langs ontsnappingsroutes te doorkruisen. De leuningen en andere middelen voor houvast moeten zo sterk zijn dat zij een verdeelde horizontale kracht van 750 N/m uitgeoefend in de richting van het midden van de gang of ruimte kunnen weerstaan, en een verdeelde verticale kracht van 750 N/m uitgeoefend naar beneden. Beide krachten hoeven niet gelijktijdig uitgeoefend te kunnen worden.  

7.3.2 De onderste 0,5 m van schotten en andere scheidingen die een verticale wand vormen langs ontsnappingsroutes moeten in staat zijn een belasting van 750 N/m te weerstaan zodat deze kunnen worden gebruikt als loopoppervlak wanneer het schip sterk overhelt.    

7.4 Evacuatie-analyse De ontsnappingsroutes moeten in een vroeg stadium van het ontwerp worden geëvalueerd door middel een evacuatie-analyse. De analyse moet worden gebruikt ter vaststelling en, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, ter wegneming van opstoppingen die bij het verlaten van het schip zouden kunnen ontstaan door de normale stroom van passagiers en bemanningsleden langs de ontsnappingsroutes, met inbegrip van de mogelijkheid dat bemanningsleden zich op deze routes in een richting tegengesteld aan die van de passagiers moeten begeven. Daarnaast moet deze analyse worden gebruikt om aan te tonen of bij de ontsnappingsvoorzieningen voldoende rekening wordt gehouden met de mogelijkheid dat bepaalde ontsnappingsroutes, verzamelplaatsen, inschepingsplaatsen of reddingboten als gevolg van een ongeluk niet bruikbaar zijn.

3.1.2 Er moet voldoende water worden aangevoerd om vier straalpijpen van een afmeting en onder een druk als aangegeven in voorschrift 10.2, te voorzien; deze moeten kunnen worden gericht op elk deel van de laadruimte, wanneer deze leeg is. Deze hoeveelheid water mag, ten genoegen van de Administratie, met behulp van gelijkwaardige middelen worden toegevoerd.  

3.1.3 Er moeten middelen aanwezig zijn om de aangewezen onderdeks gelegen laadruimte doeltreffend te kunnen koelen door middel van ten minste 5 l/min per vierkante meter; dit moet gebeuren door middel van vast aangebrachte sproeikoppen, of door de laadruimte onder water te zetten. Hiertoe kunnen in kleine laadruimten en in kleine afdelingen van grotere laadruimten, brandslangen worden gebruikt, zulks naar goeddunken van de Administratie. De spui- en lensinrichtingen moeten evenwel zodanig zijn dat de vorming van vrije vloeistofoppervlakken wordt voorkomen. Het afvoersysteem moet een zodanige capaciteit hebben dat hiermee ten minste 125% van de gezamenlijke capaciteit van zowel de pompen van de watersproei-installatie als het vereiste aantal straalpijpen kan worden afgevoerd. De afsluitkleppen van het afvoersysteem moeten van buiten de beveiligde ruimte kunnen worden bediend op een plaats in de nabijheid van de bedieningsmiddelen van de brandblusinstallatie. Lensputten moeten voldoende inhoudscapaciteit hebben en moeten bij de huid van het schip worden aangebracht op een onderlinge afstand van ten hoogste 40 m in elke waterdichte afdeling. Is dit niet mogelijk, dan moet de Administratie, voor zover zij zulks noodzakelijk acht, bij haar goedkeuring van de stabiliteitsgegevens rekening houden met de nadelige invloed van het toegevoegde gewicht en het vrije vloeistofoppervlak op de stabiliteit.  

3.1.4 Voorzieningen om een aangewezen onderdeks gelegen laadruimte met doeltreffende, met name genoemde middelen onder water te zetten, kunnen in de plaats worden gesteld van het vereiste in paragraaf 3.1.3.  

3.1.5 De totaal vereiste capaciteit van de watertoevoer moet gelijktijdig voldoen aan de paragrafen 3.1.2 en 3.1.3, indien van toepassing, berekend voor de grootste aangewezen laadruimte. Aan de capaciteitsvereisten van paragraaf 3.1.2 moet worden voldaan door de totale capaciteit van de hoofdbrandpomp(en), de capaciteit van een eventueel aangebrachte noodbrandpomp niet meegerekend. Indien een drenchersysteem wordt gebruikt om aan de vereisten van paragraaf 3.1.3 te voldoen, moet de drencherpomp bij de berekening van de totale capaciteit worden betrokken.    

3.2 Ontstekingsbronnen In omsloten laadruimten of voertuigruimten mag geen elektrische apparatuur en bekabeling worden aangebracht, tenzij dit naar het oordeel van de Administratie van essentieel belang is voor bedrijfsvoering aan boord. Indien in dergelijke ruimten echter wel elektrische apparatuur wordt aangebracht, moet deze van een type zijn dat erkend veilig is in gevaarlijke omgevingen waaraan deze wordt blootgesteld, tenzij het mogelijk is het elektrisch systeem volledig te isoleren (door het verwijderen van verbindingen, anders dan zekeringen). Wanneer kabels door dekken en schotten worden gevoerd, moet de doorvoeropening zijn afgedicht tegen (doorlating van) gas of damp. Doorgevoerde kabels en kabels in laadruimten moeten worden beschermd tegen beschadiging door stoten. Alle andere uitrusting die een bron van ontsteking van brandbare damp kan vormen, is niet toegestaan.  

3.3 Detectie-installatie In ro-ro-ruimten moet een vaste branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie zijn aangebracht die voldoet aan de vereisten van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen. Alle andere typen laadruimten moeten zijn voorzien van ofwel een vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie, ofwel een rookdetectie-installatie die luchtmonsters neemt die voldoet aan de vereisten van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen. Indien een rookdetectie-installatie die luchtmonsters neemt wordt aangebracht, moet bijzondere aandacht worden geschonken aan paragraaf 2.1.3 van hoofdstuk 10 van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen, teneinde te voorkomen dat giftige dampen binnendringen in bemande ruimten.  

3.4 *Ventilatie* 

3.4.1 Omsloten laadruimten moeten zijn voorzien van toereikende mechanische ventilatie. Het systeem moet zodanig zijn dat ten minste zes luchtwisselingen per uur in de laadruimte kunnen plaatsvinden op basis van een lege laadruimte en dat uit de hoger of lager gelegen delen van de laadruimte, al naar gelang, dampen kunnen worden afgevoerd.  

3.4.2 De ventilatoren moeten zo zijn uitgevoerd dat de mogelijkheid van ontsteking van ontvlambare mengsels van gas en lucht wordt voorkomen. De in- en uitlaatopeningen voor de ventilatie moeten zijn afgeschermd door hiertoe geschikte gaasroosters.  

3.4.3 Op omsloten laadruimten bestemd voor het vervoer van vaste gevaarlijke stoffen in bulk moet natuurlijke ventilatie worden aangebracht, indien geen voorziening voor mechanische ventilatie aanwezig is.    

3.5 Lenzen 

3.5.1 Wanneer het de bedoeling is ontvlambare of giftige vloeistoffen te vervoeren in omsloten laadruimten, moet het lenssysteem zo zijn ontworpen dat deze vloeistoffen niet door onoplettendheid door leidingen of pompen in machineruimten kunnen worden gepompt. Wanneer er grote hoeveelheden ontvlambare of giftige vloeistoffen worden vervoerd, moet worden overwogen aanvullende middelen voor het lenzen van dergelijke laadruimten aan te brengen.  

3.5.2 Indien het lenswaterafvoersysteem een aanvulling vormt op het systeem dat wordt bediend door de pompen in de machineruimte, moet de capaciteit van het systeem ten minste 10 m3/u bedragen per laadruimte die erdoor wordt bediend. Indien het aanvullende systeem een algemeen systeem is, behoeft de capaciteit niet meer te bedragen dan 25 m3/u. Het aanvullende lenssysteem behoeft niet dubbel te worden uitgevoerd.  

3.5.3 Wanneer ontvlambare of giftige vloeistoffen worden vervoerd, moet de lenspijp die de machineruimte ingaat worden geïsoleerd door middel van een blinde flens of een gesloten vergrendelbare klep.  

3.5.4 Omsloten ruimten, buiten machineruimten, waarin lenspompen zijn ondergebracht die laadruimten bedienen die zijn bestemd voor het vervoer van ontvlambare of giftige vloeistoffen, moeten worden uitgerust met een aparte mechanische ventilatie met een capaciteit van ten minste zes luchtwisselingen per uur. Indien deze ruimte vanuit een andere omsloten ruimte toegankelijk is, moet de deur zelfsluitend zijn.  

3.5.5 Indien de lenswaterafvoer in laadruimten plaatsvindt door middel van de zwaartekracht, moet het afvoerwater ofwel rechtstreeks overboord worden geloosd, ofwel worden opgevangen in een gesloten lenswatertank buiten de machineruimte. De tank moet zijn uitgerust met een ontluchtingspijp die uitkomt op een veilige plaats op het open dek. Afvoer uit een laadruimte in een lensput op een lager dek is uitsluitend toegestaan wanneer die ruimte voldoet aan dezelfde vereisten als bovengenoemde laadruimte.    

3.6 Persoonlijke bescherming 

3.6.1 Er moeten, naast de krachtens voorschrift 10.10 vereiste brandweeruitrusting, vier stellen volledig beschermende, chemicaliënbestendige kleding aanwezig zijn en wordt gekozen rekening houdend met de gevaren die verband houden met de te vervoeren chemische stoffen en met de door de Organisatie ontwikkelde normen in overeenstemming met de klasse en fysieke staat . De beschermende kleding moet de gehele huid bedekken, zodat geen enkel deel van het lichaam onbeschermd is. <sup> *  Voor vaste lading in bulk moet de beschermende kleding voldoen aan de uitrustingvereisten vermeld in de desbetreffende overzichten in de IMSBC-Code voor de afzonderlijke stoffen. Voor verpakte goederen moet de beschermende kleding voldoen aan de uitrustingsvereisten vermeld in de noodmaatregelen en -procedures (EmS) uit de bijlage bij de IMDG-Code voor de afzonderlijke stoffen.  </sup>  

3.6.2 Afgezien van de krachtens voorschrift 10 vereiste persluchttoestellen, moeten er nog twee van zulke toestellen aanwezig zijn. Voor elk vereist ademhalingstoestel moeten twee reservevullingen aanwezig zijn die geschikt zijn om met het ademhalingstoestel te worden gebruikt. Op passagiersschepen die niet meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren en op vrachtschepen die zijn voorzien van op geschikte plaatsen aangebrachte inrichtingen voor het zonder besmetting volledig opnieuw vullen van de luchtcilinders, behoeft slechts één reservevulling voor elk vereist ademhalingstoestel aanwezig te zijn.    

3.7 Draagbare brandblustoestellen Voor de laadruimten moeten draagbare brandblustoestellen met een totale capaciteit van ten minste 12 kg droogpoeder of een hiermee gelijk te stellen blusvermogen aanwezig zijn. Deze blustoestellen zijn vereist naast eventuele, elders in dit hoofdstuk vereiste draagbare brandblustoestellen.  

3.8 Isolatie van begrenzingswanden van machineruimten Schotten die begrenzingswanden tussen laadruimten en machineruimten van categorie A vormen, moeten worden geïsoleerd volgens de norm voor klasse „A-60”, tenzij de gevaarlijke stoffen op een afstand van ten minste 3 m, horizontaal gemeten, vanaf zulke schotten zijn gestuwd. Andere begrenzingswanden tussen zulke ruimten moeten worden geïsoleerd volgens de norm voor klasse „A-60”.  

3.9 Watersproei-installatie Iedere open ro-ro-ruimte waarboven zich een dek bevindt en iedere ruimte die wordt beschouwd als een gesloten ro-ro-ruimte die niet kan worden afgedicht, moet zijn voorzien van een goedgekeurde, vast aangebrachte, met de hand te bedienen watersproei-installatie die alle delen van elk dek en elk autodek in de ruimte moet beveiligen, met dien verstande dat de Administratie kan toestaan dat een andere vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie wordt gebruikt, mits deze door een proefneming op ware grootte niet minder doeltreffend is gebleken. De spui- en lensinrichtingen moeten evenwel zodanig zijn dat de vorming van vrije vloeistofoppervlakken wordt voorkomen. Het afvoersysteem moet een zodanige capaciteit hebben dat hiermee ten minste 125% van de gezamenlijke capaciteit van zowel de pompen van de watersproei-installatie als van het vereiste aantal brandslangstraalpijpen kan worden afgevoerd. De afsluitkleppen van het afvoersysteem moeten van buiten de beveiligde ruimte kunnen worden bediend op een plaats in de nabijheid van de bedieningsmiddelen van de brandblusinstallatie. Lensputten moeten voldoende inhoudscapaciteit hebben en moeten bij de huid van het schip worden aangebracht op een onderlinge afstand van ten hoogste 40 m in elke waterdichte afdeling. Is dit niet mogelijk, dan moet de Administratie, voor zover zij zulks noodzakelijk acht, bij haar goedkeuring van de stabiliteitsgegevens rekening houden met de nadelige invloed van het toegevoegde gewicht en het vrije vloeistofoppervlak op de stabiliteit.  

3.10 Scheiding van ro-ro-ruimten 

3.10.1 Op schepen met ro-ro-ruimten moet een afscheiding zijn aangebracht tussen een gesloten ro-ro-ruimte en een aangrenzende open ro-ro-ruimte. De afscheiding moet zodanig zijn dat de doorstroming van gevaarlijke dampen en vloeistoffen tussen dergelijke ruimten tot een minimum wordt beperkt. Een dergelijke afscheiding behoeft niet te worden aangebracht indien de ro-ro-ruimte over de volle lengte wordt beschouwd als een gesloten ruimte, die moet voldoen aan de relevante bijzondere vereisten van dit voorschrift.  

3.10.2 Op schepen met ro-ro-ruimten moet een afscheiding zijn aangebracht tussen een gesloten ro-ro-ruimte en het aangrenzende aan weer en wind blootgestelde dek. De afscheiding moet zodanig zijn dat de doorstroming van gevaarlijke dampen en vloeistoffen tussen dergelijke ruimten tot een minimum wordt beperkt. Een dergelijke afscheiding behoeft niet te worden aangebracht indien de voorzieningen voor de gesloten ro-ro-ruimten in overeenstemming zijn met hetgeen vereist wordt voor de gevaarlijke goederen die worden vervoerd op aangrenzende, aan weer en wind blootgestelde dekken.      

4 Verklaring dat wordt voldaan aan de eisen De Administratie moet het schip voorzien van een officieel document waaruit blijkt dat de constructie en de uitrusting voldoen aan de in dit voorschrift vervatte eisen. Certificering voor gevaarlijke stoffen, behoudens vaste gevaarlijke stoffen in bulk, is niet vereist voor lading van klasse 6.2 en 7, en gevaarlijke stoffen in kleine hoeveelheden en vrijgestelde hoeveelheden.  *Tabel 19.1 – Toepassing van de eisen op de verschillende methoden van vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen op schepen en in laadruimten*  **Waar in tabel 19.1 een „X” staat aangegeven betekent dit dat deze eis geldt voor alle klassen gevaarlijke stoffen als vermeld in de desbetreffende kolom van tabel 19.3, behoudens de vermelding in de noten.

### Voorschrift  20  

####Beveiliging van voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten

1 Doel Het doel van dit voorschrift is aanvullende veiligheidsmaatregelen te bieden ter ondersteuning van de brandveiligheidsdoelen van dit hoofdstuk voor schepen die zijn uitgerust met voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten. Hiertoe moet aan de volgende functionele vereisten worden voldaan: 

.1 er moeten brandbeveiligingssystemen aanwezig zijn om het schip deugdelijk te beveiligen tegen brandrisico’s die samenhangen met voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten;  

.2 ontstekingsbronnen moeten worden gescheiden van voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten; en  

.3 voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten moeten goed worden geventileerd.    

2 Algemene vereisten 

2.1 Toepassing In aanvulling op de vereisten van de relevante voorschriften in de delen B, C, D en E, moeten voertuigruimten, ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten voldoen aan de bepalingen van dit voorschrift.  

2.2 Fundamentele beginselen voor passagiersschepen 

2.2.1 Het fundamentele beginsel dat aan het bepaalde in dit voorschrift ten grondslag ligt, is dat de normale indeling in verticale hoofdsecties vereist krachtens voorschrift 9.2 mogelijk niet uitvoerbaar is in voertuigruimten op passagiersschepen en dat, derhalve, gelijkwaardige bescherming in dergelijke ruimten moet worden bereikt op basis van een indeling in horizontale secties en de installatie van een doeltreffende vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie. Voor de toepassing van dit voorschrift kan een horizontale sectie ingevolge deze opvatting ruimten van bijzondere aard, die op meer dan één dek zijn gelegen, omvatten, mits de totale vrije doorrijhoogte voor voertuigen niet meer dan 10 m bedraagt.  

2.2.2 Het fundamentele beginsel dat aan de bepalingen van paragraaf 2.2.1 ten grondslag ligt, is eveneens van toepassing op ro-ro-ruimten  

2.2.3 De vereisten voor ventilatiesystemen, openingen in schotten van klasse „A” en doorvoeringen in schotten van klasse „A” inzake de handhaving van de brandwerendheid van verticale secties in dit hoofdstuk zijn ook van toepassing op dekken en schotten die de begrenzingen vormen waardoor horizontale secties van elkaar en van het overige gedeelte van het schip worden gescheiden.      

3 Voorzorgsmaatregelen tegen de ontsteking van ontvlambare dampen in gesloten voertuigruimten, gesloten ro-ro-ruimten en ruimten van bijzondere aard 

3.1 Ventilatiesystemen 

3.1.1 Capaciteit van ventilatiesystemen Er moet worden voorzien in een doeltreffend mechanisch ventilatiesysteem dat voldoende capaciteit heeft om ten minste de volgende aantallen luchtwisselingen te geven: 

.1 Passagiersschepen  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Ruimten van bijzondere aard  | 10 luchtwisselingen per uur  |
| Gesloten ro-ro ruimten en voertuigruimten anders dan ruimten van bijzondere aard op schepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren  | 10 luchtwisselingen per uur  |
| Gesloten ro-ro ruimten en voertuigruimten anders dan ruimten van bijzondere aard op schepen die niet meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren  | 6 luchtwisselingen per uur  |

.2  

| --- | --- |
|:---|:---|
| Vrachtschepen  | 6 luchtwisselingen per uur  |

De Administratie kan een groter aantal luchtwisselingen eisen wanneer de voertuigen van of aan boord worden gereden.  

3.1.2 Werking van ventilatiesystemen 

3.1.2.1 Het krachtens paragraaf 3.1.1 vereiste mechanische ventilatiesysteem moet op passagiersschepen gescheiden zijn van andere ventilatiesystemen en moet wanneer voertuigen in dergelijke ruimten aanwezig zijn, voortdurend in werking zijn. Ventilatiekanalen die dergelijke laadruimten bedienen welke doeltreffend luchtdicht kunnen worden afgesloten, moeten voor ieder van deze ruimten worden gescheiden. Het systeem moet kunnen worden bediend vanuit een plaats buiten dergelijke ruimten.  

3.1.2.2 Op vrachtschepen moeten ventilatoren onder normale omstandigheden ononderbroken in bedrijf zijn, wanneer er zich voertuigen aan boord bevinden. Wanneer dit niet uitvoerbaar is, moeten zij dagelijks, afhankelijk van de weersomstandigheden, en in ieder geval gedurende een redelijke tijd voorafgaande aan de ontscheping, gedurende een beperkte tijd in bedrijf worden gesteld, waarna moet worden aangetoond dat de ro-ro-ruimte of voertuigruimte gasvrij is. Hiertoe moeten één of meer draagbare instrumenten voor het opsporen van brandbare gassen aan boord zijn. Dit systeem moet volledig zijn gescheiden van andere ventilatiesystemen. Ventilatiekanalen die ro-ro-ruimten of voertuigruimten bedienen, moeten per laadruimte op doeltreffende wijze kunnen worden afgesloten. Het systeem moet kunnen worden bediend vanuit een plaats buiten dergelijke ruimten.  

3.1.2.3 Het ventilatiesysteem moet zodanig zijn dat het vormen van luchtlagen en luchtzakken wordt voorkomen.    

3.1.3 Aanduiding van ventilatiesystemen Op de navigatiebrug moeten middelen zijn aangebracht die aangeven wanneer de vereiste ventilatiecapaciteit vermindert.  

3.1.4 Inrichtingen voor het afsluiten en kanalen Er moeten voorzieningen zijn aangebracht om het ventilatiesysteem in geval van brand vanaf een plaats buiten de ruimte snel te kunnen stopzetten en doeltreffend te kunnen afsluiten, daarbij rekening houdend met de weersomstandigheden en de toestand van de zee. 

3.1.4.2 Ventilatiekanalen, met inbegrip van brandkleppen, binnen een gemeenschappelijke horizontale sectie moeten zijn vervaardigd van staal. Op passagiersschepen moeten ventilatiekanalen die door andere horizontale secties of machineruimten lopen van staal van klasse „A-60” zijn en zijn vervaardigd in overeenstemming met de voorschriften 9.7.2.1.1 en 9.7.2.1.2.    

3.1.5 Permanente openingen Permanente openingen in de huidbeplating, de einden of dekken van de ruimte moeten zodanig zijn geplaatst dat brand in de laadruimte geen gevaar oplevert voor stuwageruimten en inschepingsplaatsen voor reddingboten en -vlotten, ruimten voor accommodatie, dienstruimten en controlestations in de bovenbouwen en dekhuizen boven de laadruimten.    

3.2 Elektrische apparatuur en bekabeling 

3.2.1 Behoudens het bepaalde in paragraaf 3.2.2 moeten de elektrische apparatuur en bekabeling van een type zijn dat geschikt is voor gebruik in ontplofbare mengsels van benzine en lucht.  

3.2.2 In het geval van andere ruimten dan ruimten van bijzondere aard onder het schottendek kan, onverminderd de bepalingen van bovenstaande paragraaf 3.2.1, boven een hoogte van 450 mm gemeten vanaf het dek en vanaf elk eventueel aangebracht platform voor voertuigen, behalve platforms met openingen die groot genoeg zijn om benzinegassen naar onderen te laten wegtrekken, elektrische apparatuur van een zodanig gesloten en beschermd type dat er geen vonken kunnen ontsnappen, worden toegestaan bij wijze van alternatief, op voorwaarde dat het ventilatiesysteem zodanig is ontworpen en functioneert dat de laadruimten voortdurend worden geventileerd met een capaciteit van ten minste tien luchtwisselingen per uur wanneer er voertuigen aan boord zijn.    

3.3 Elektrische apparatuur en bekabeling in afzuigkanalen van de ventilatie Indien elektrische apparatuur en bekabeling worden aangebracht in een afzuigkanaal van de ventilatie, moeten deze zijn goedgekeurd voor gebruik in ontplofbare mengsels van benzine en lucht; de uitlaat van een afzuigkanaal moet op een veilige plaats zijn gelegen, gelet op andere mogelijke ontstekingsbronnen.  

3.4 Andere ontstekingsbronnen Andere apparatuur die een ontstekingsbron van ontvlambare dampmengsels zou kunnen vormen, is niet toegestaan.  

3.5 Spuipijpen en sanitaire uitlaten Spuipijpen mogen niet worden gevoerd naar machineruimten of andere ruimten waarin zich ontstekingsbronnen kunnen bevinden.    

4 Detectie en alarmering 

4.1 Vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallaties Behoudens het bepaalde in paragraaf 4.3.1 moet er een vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie aanwezig zijn die voldoet aan de vereisten van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen. De vast aangebrachte branddetectie-installatie moet in staat zijn het begin van een brand snel te detecteren. Het type detectors, de onderlinge afstand en de plaats ervan moeten ten genoegen van de Administratie zijn, rekening houdend met de effecten van de ventilatie en andere relevante factoren. Na het aanbrengen moet de installatie worden beproefd onder normale omstandigheden wat betreft ventilatie, waarbij de gemiddelde reactietijd ten genoegen van de Administratie moet zijn.  

4.2 Rookdetectie-installaties die luchtmonsters nemen Behalve in open ro-ro-ruimten, open voertuigruimten en ruimten van bijzondere aard, mag een rookdetectie-installatie die luchtmonsters neemt die aan de vereisten van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen voldoet, worden gebruikt als alternatief voor de in paragraaf 4.1 vereiste vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie.  

4.3 Ruimten van bijzondere aard 

4.3.1 In ruimten van bijzondere aard moet een doeltreffende brandrondedienst worden onderhouden. Wanneer een doeltreffende brandrondedienst wordt onderhouden door een voortdurend aanwezige brandwacht tijdens de gehele reis, is een vast aangebrachte branddetectie- en brandalarminstallatie niet vereist.  

4.3.2 Met de hand bediende meldingspunten moeten zodanig in de ruimte worden verdeeld dat geen enkel deel van de ruimte meer dan 20 m verwijderd is van een met de hand bediend meldingspunt, en één alarm moet worden geplaatst dicht bij elke uitgang van deze ruimten.      

5 Structurele bescherming Onverminderd de bepalingen van voorschrift 9.2.2 moeten de wandschotten en dekken van ruimten van bijzondere aard en ro-ro-ruimten op passagiersschepen die meer dan 36 passagiers vervoeren, worden geïsoleerd volgens de norm voor klasse „A-60”. Indien zich aan één zijde van het schot een ruimte van categorie (5), (9) en/of (10), als omschreven in paragraaf 9.2.2.3, bevindt, kan de norm echter worden verlaagd naar „A-0”. Indien zich onder een ruimte van bijzondere aard of ro-ro-ruimte brandstofolietanks bevinden, mag de brandwerendheid van het dek tussen deze ruimten worden verlaagd naar „A-0”.  

6 Brand blussen 

6.1 Vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallaties 

6.1.1 In voertuigruimten en ro-ro-ruimten die geen ruimten van bijzondere aard zijn en die kunnen worden afgedicht vanaf een plaats buiten de laadruimten, moet een vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie met verstikkend gas aanwezig zijn die voldoet aan de bepalingen van de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen, met dien verstande dat: 

.1 indien een kooldioxide-brandblusinstallatie wordt aangebracht, de beschikbare hoeveelheid gas ten minste voldoende moet zijn om een volume aan vrij gas op te leveren dat gelijk is aan 45% van de bruto-inhoud van de grootste aldus beschermde ruimte en de voorzieningen zodanig moeten zijn dat hierdoor wordt verzekerd dat ten minste twee derde van de voor de desbetreffende ruimte vereiste hoeveelheid gas binnen 10 minuten hierin kan instromen;  

.2 elke andere vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie met inert gas of vast aangebrachte schuimbrandblusinstallatie met een hoog verschuimingsgetal mag worden geïnstalleerd, mits ten genoegen van de Administratie wordt aangetoond dat hierdoor een gelijkwaardige bescherming wordt geboden; en  

.3 bij wijze van alternatief een brandblusinstallatie mag worden aangebracht die voldoet aan de in paragraaf 6.1.2 gestelde eisen.    

6.1.2 Ro-ro-ruimten en voertuigruimten die niet kunnen worden afgedicht, alsmede ruimten van bijzondere aard moeten zijn voorzien van een goedgekeurde, vast aangebrachte, met de hand te bedienen watersproei-installatie die alle delen van elk dek en elk autodek in zo’n ruimte moet beschermen. Dergelijke watersproei-installaties moeten zijn voorzien van: 

.1 een drukmeter op de afsluiter van de verzamelleiding;  

.2 een duidelijke markering op elke afsluiter van de verzamelleiding waarop wordt vermeld welke ruimte wordt bediend;  

.3 instructies voor onderhoud en werking die op een plaats in het afsluiterhuis worden bewaard; en  

.4 een voldoende aantal afvoerafsluiters.    

6.1.3 De Administratie kan het gebruik van een andere vast aangebrachte brandblusinstallatie toestaan, waarvan door een proefneming op ware grootte onder omstandigheden waarin een brand van de benzinestroom werd nagebootst in een voertuigruimte of een ro-ro-ruimte, is aangetoond dat deze niet minder doeltreffend is bij het bedwingen van branden die in een dergelijke ruimte kunnen worden verwacht.  

6.1.4 Het vereiste van deze paragraaf is van toepassing op schepen gebouwd op of na 1 januari 2010. Schepen gebouwd op of na 1 juli 2002 en voor 1 januari 2010 moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 6.1.4, als gewijzigd bij resolutie MSC.99(73) die voordien van toepassing waren. Wanneer vaste sproei-installaties voor water onder druk worden aangebracht moeten, met het oog op ernstig verlies aan stabiliteit dat zou kunnen optreden door de opeenhoping van grote hoeveelheden water op het dek of de dekken tijdens het gebruik van de vaste sproei-installatie voor water onder druk, de volgende voorzieningen worden getroffen: 

.1 op passagiersschepen: 

.1.1 in de ruimten boven het schottendek moeten spuipijpen worden aangebracht teneinde zeker te stellen dat dit water snel rechtstreeks overboord wordt afgevoerd, daarbij de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren in acht nemend ; <sup> 6)  Zie de door de Organisatie op te stellen Richtsnoeren voor afvoersystemen in gesloten voertuig- en ro-ro ruimten en ruimten van bijzondere aard.  </sup> 

1.2.1 op ro-ro-passagiersschepen moeten de lozingskleppen van de spuipijpen, voorzien van directe sluitvoorzieningen die bedienbaar zijn vanaf een positie boven het schottendek in overeenstemming met de vereisten van het van kracht zijnde [Internationaal Verdrag betreffende de uitwatering van schepen](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/international/convention/on/load/lines/1966/BWBV0003267/README.md), geopend blijven zolang het schip zich op zee bevindt;  

.1.2.2 elke bediening van de in paragraaf 6.1.4.1.2.1 bedoelde kleppen moet worden vermeld in het logboek;    

.1.3 de Administratie kan verlangen dat in de ruimten onder het schottendek in aanvulling op de vereisten van voorschrift II-1/35-1 pomp- en afvoervoorzieningen worden aangebracht. In een dergelijk geval moet het afvoersysteem een zodanige capaciteit hebben dat hiermee ten minste 125% van de gezamenlijke capaciteit van zowel de pompen van de watersproei-installatie als van het vereiste aantal brandslangstraalpijpen kan worden afgevoerd, daarbij de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren in acht nemend. De afsluitkleppen van het afvoersysteem moeten van buiten de beveiligde ruimte kunnen worden bediend op een plaats in de nabijheid van de bedieningsmiddelen van de brandblusinstallatie. Lensputten moeten voldoende inhoudscapaciteit hebben en moeten bij de huid van het schip worden aangebracht op een onderlinge afstand van ten hoogste 40 m in elke waterdichte afdeling; <sup> 5)  Zie de door de Organisatie op te stellen Richtsnoeren voor de constructie, installatie, het onderhoud en de inspectie/onderzoek van accommodatieladders en loopbruggen.  </sup>    

.2 op vrachtschepen moeten de spui- en lensinrichtingen zodanig zijn dat het ontstaan van vrije vloeistofoppervlakken wordt voorkomen. In een dergelijk geval moet het afvoersysteem een zodanige capaciteit hebben dat hiermee ten minste 125% van de gezamenlijke capaciteit van zowel de pompen van de watersproei-installatie als van het vereiste aantal brandslangstraalpijpen kan worden afgevoerd, daarbij de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren in aanmerking nemend . De afsluitkleppen van het afvoersysteem moeten van buiten de beveiligde ruimte kunnen worden bediend op een plaats in de nabijheid van de bedieningsmiddelen van de brandblusinstallatie. Lensputten moeten voldoende inhoudscapaciteit hebben en moeten bij de huid van het schip worden aangebracht op een onderlinge afstand van ten hoogste 40 m in elke waterdichte afdeling. Is dit niet mogelijk, dan moet de Administratie, voor zover zij zulks noodzakelijk acht, bij haar goedkeuring van de stabiliteitsgegevens rekening houden met de nadelige invloed van het toegevoegde gewicht en het vrije vloeistofoppervlak op de stabiliteit . Deze informatie wordt opgenomen in de stabiliteitsgegevens die conform voorschrift II-1/5-1 aan de kapitein worden verstrekt. <sup> 5)  Zie de door de Organisatie op te stellen Richtsnoeren voor de constructie, installatie, het onderhoud en de inspectie/onderzoek van accommodatieladders en loopbruggen.  </sup> <sup> 7)  Zie de Aanbeveling inzake vaste brandblusinstallaties voor ruimten van bijzondere aard, aangenomen door de Organisatie bij resolutie A.123(V).  </sup>    

6.1.5 Op alle schepen moeten in ruimten voor gesloten voertuigen en ro-ro ruimten alsmede in ruimten van bijzondere aard, waar vaste sproei-installaties voor water onder druk zijn aangebracht, middelen beschikbaar zijn waarmee voorkomen wordt dat lensputten verstopt of geblokkeerd raken, daarbij de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren in aanmerking nemend . Schepen gebouwd vóór 1 januari 2010 moeten bij het eerste onderzoek na 1 januari 2010 aan de vereisten van deze paragraaf voldoen. <sup> 5)  Zie de door de Organisatie op te stellen Richtsnoeren voor de constructie, installatie, het onderhoud en de inspectie/onderzoek van accommodatieladders en loopbruggen.  </sup>    

6.2 Draagbare brandblustoestellen 

6.2.1 Op elk dekniveau moeten in elk ruim of in elke afdeling waarin voertuigen worden vervoerd aan beide zijden van de ruimte draagbare brandblustoestellen zijn aangebracht, met een tussenruimte van ten hoogste 20 m. Bij iedere toegang tot zo’n laadruimte moet zich ten minste één draagbaar brandblustoestel bevinden.  

6.2.2 In aanvulling op het bepaalde in paragraaf 6.2.1 moeten de volgende brandblusinstallaties zijn aangebracht in voertuigruimten, ro-ro-ruimten en ruimten van bijzondere aard bestemd voor het vervoer van motorvoertuigen met brandstof in de tank voor eigen aandrijving: 

.1 ten minste drie nevellansen; en  

.2 één draagbaar schuimbrandblusapparaat, dat voldoet aan het bepaalde in de Code inzake brandveiligheidssystemen, met dien verstande dat er op het schip ten minste twee van zulke apparaten voor gebruik in zulke ruimten beschikbaar moeten zijn.

####ALGEMEEN

### Voorschrift  1  

####Toepassing

1 Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders is bepaald, is dit hoofdstuk van toepassing op schepen waarvan de kiel is gelegd of waarvan de bouw zich in een soortgelijk stadium bevindt op of na 1 juli 1998.  

2 Voor de toepassing van dit hoofdstuk wordt verstaan onder *een soortgelijk bouwstadium* het stadium waarin: 

.1 de bouw specifiek voor een bepaald schip aanvangt; en  

.2 is aangevangen met de montage van dat schip, dat ten minste 50 ton of 1 procent van de geschatte massa van alle bouwmateriaal omvat, naar gelang van welke van beide het minst is.    

3 Voor de toepassing van dit hoofdstuk: 

.1 wordt verstaan onder *schepen die worden gebouwd: schepen waarvan de kiel wordt gelegd of waarvan de bouw zich in een soortgelijk stadium bevindt;*  

.2 wordt verstaan onder *alle schepen*: schepen gebouwd vóór, op of na 1 juli 1998; de uitdrukkingen *alle passagiersschepen* en *alle vrachtschepen* worden dienovereenkomstig uitgelegd;  

.3 wordt een vrachtschip – ongeacht wanneer dit is gebouwd – dat wordt verbouwd tot passagiersschip, beschouwd als een passagiersschip gebouwd op de datum waarop een dergelijke verbouwing wordt aangevangen.    

4 Voor schepen gebouwd vóór 1 juli 1998, moet de Administratie: 

.1 er voor zorg dragen dat, met inachtneming van het bepaalde in paragraaf 4.2, wordt voldaan aan de vereisten die krachtens Hoofdstuk III van het Internationaal Verdrag voor de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, 1974, vóór 1 juli 1998 van toepassing zijn op nieuwe of bestaande schepen, zoals in genoemd hoofdstuk is voorgeschreven; en  

.2 er voor zorg dragen dat wanneer reddingsmiddelen of -voorzieningen op dergelijke schepen worden vervangen, of wanneer dergelijke schepen reparaties, veranderingen of wijzigingen van ingrijpende aard ondergaan die vervanging van, of een aanvulling op hun bestaande reddingsmiddelen of -voorzieningen met zich meebrengen, deze reddingsmiddelen of -voorzieningen, voor zover dat redelijk en uitvoerbaar is, voldoen aan de vereisten van dit hoofdstuk. Wanneer echter een reddingsboot of -vlot anders dan een opblaasbaar reddingsvlot wordt vervangen zonder het bijbehorende tewaterlatingsmiddel te vervangen, of omgekeerd, dan kan de reddingsboot, het reddingsvlot of het tewaterlatingsmiddel van hetzelfde type zijn als dat wat wordt vervangen.      

### Voorschrift  2  

####Vrijstellingen

1 De Administratie kan, wanneer zij van oordeel is dat de beschutte aard en de omstandigheden van de reis zodanig zijn dat toepassing van bepaalde vereisten van dit hoofdstuk redelijk noch noodzakelijk is, bepaalde schepen of klassen van schepen, die in de loop van hun reis niet meer dan 20 zeemijl uit het dichtstbijzijnde land varen, vrijstellen van die vereisten.  

2 Wanneer passagiersschepen worden gebruikt op bijzondere reizen voor het vervoer van grote aantallen passagiers op deze reizen, zoals bij het pelgrimsvervoer, kan de Administratie, indien zij ervan overtuigd is dat het praktisch onuitvoerbaar is naleving van de vereisten van dit hoofdstuk op te leggen, dergelijke schepen vrijstellen van die vereisten, mits die schepen volledig voldoen aan de bepalingen van: 

.1 de voorschriften gehecht aan de Overeenkomst betreffende passagiersschepen gebezigd op bijzondere reizen, 1971; en  

.2 de voorschriften gehecht aan het Protocol betreffende de vereisten ten aanzien van passagiersruimten op passagiersschepen gebruikt op bijzondere reizen.

.2 op een plaats die geschikt is voor het te water laten en het terugplaatsen;  

.3 zodanig dat noch de hulpverleningsboten noch de plaatsingsvoorzieningen de werking van een reddingsboot of -vlot op een andere tewaterlatingsplaats belemmeren;  

.4 overeenkomstig de bepalingen van voorschrift 13, indien ze tevens reddingsboot zijn.    

### Voorschrift  15  

####Plaatsing van mariene evacuatiesystemen

1 In de scheepszijde mogen geen openingen zijn tussen de inschepingsplaats van het mariene evacuatiesysteem en de waterlijn in ballasttoestand en voorzieningen moeten zijn getroffen om het systeem te beschermen tegen uitstekende delen.  

2 Om veilige tewaterlating te waarborgen, moet de opstelling van mariene evacuatiesystemen zodanig zijn dat bijzondere aandacht wordt geschonken aan de afstand tot de schroef en de sterk uitstekende gedeelten van de romp en dat het systeem zoveel mogelijk langs het verticale gedeelte van de zijde van het schip afgevierd kan worden.  

3 De plaatsing van elk marien evacuatiesysteem moet zodanig zijn dat noch de vrije doorgang, noch het platform, noch de plaatsing of de bedieningsvoorzieningen ervan de werking van enig ander reddingsmiddel op een andere tewaterlatingsplaats belemmeren;  

4 Waar toepasselijk moet het op het schip zo worden ingedeeld dat de mariene evacuatiesystemen op hun opstellingsplaatsen beschermd zijn tegen schade door overkomend water.    

### Voorschrift  16  

####Voorzieningen voor tewaterlating en terugzetten van reddingsboten en -vlotten

1 Tenzij uitdrukkelijk anders bepaald, moeten tewaterlatingsmiddelen en inschepingsvoorzieningen die voldoen aan de vereisten van deel 6.1 van de Code beschikbaar zijn voor alle reddingsboten en -vlotten behalve voor:

### Voorschrift  19  

####Instructies en oefeningen voor noodgevallen

1 Dit voorschrift is van toepassing op alle schepen.  

2 Vertrouwdheid met de veiligheidsvoorzieningen en verlaatrollen 

2.1 Ieder bemanningslid aan wie taken in noodsituaties zijn opgedragen moet vertrouwd zijn met deze taken voordat de reis begint.  

2.2 Aan boord van een schip dat een reis maakt waarbij de passagiers volgens planning meer dan 24 uur aan boord blijven, moet de verlaatrol voor de passagiers binnen 24 uur na inscheping plaatsvinden. De passagiers moeten worden voorgelicht over het gebruik van reddingsgordels en de te verrichten handelingen in geval van nood.  

2.3 Steeds wanneer nieuwe passagiers inschepen, moeten de passagiers direct vóór of na vertrek veiligheidsinstructies krijgen. De uitleg moet de instructies omvatten die worden vereist door de voorschriften 8.2 en 8.4 en plaatsvinden door middel van een oproep in één of meer talen waarvan het waarschijnlijk is dat zij worden verstaan door de passagiers. De oproep moet worden gedaan via het scheepsomroepsysteem of een vergelijkbaar middel dat waarschijnlijk wordt gehoord door ten minste de passagiers die de oproep nog niet eerder hebben gehoord tijdens de reis. De uitleg kan worden opgenomen in de verlaatrol vereist door paragraaf 2.2, indien de verlaatrol direct na vertrek plaatsvindt. Instructiekaarten of -platen of videoprogramma's die worden vertoond op de videoschermen van het schip kunnen worden gebruikt ter aanvulling op de uitleg, maar zij mogen niet worden gebruikt als vervanging van de oproep.    

3 Oefeningen 

3.1 Voor zover uitvoerbaar moeten de oefeningen worden uitgevoerd alsof er een daadwerkelijke noodsituatie heerst.  

3.2 Ieder bemanningslid moet aan ten minste één verlaatrol en één brandrol in de maand deelnemen. De oefeningen voor de bemanning moeten plaatsvinden binnen 24 uur nadat het schip een haven heeft verlaten wanneer meer dan 25% van de bemanning in de voorafgaande maand niet heeft deelgenomen aan verlaat- en brandrollen aan boord van het desbetreffende schip. Wanneer een schip voor het eerst in de vaart wordt genomen, een grote wijziging heeft ondergaan of nadat een nieuwe bemanning is aangesteld, moeten deze oefeningen vóór vertrek plaatsvinden. De Administratie kan andere regelingen die ten minste gelijkwaardig zijn, aanvaarden voor die soorten schepen waarvoor deze onuitvoerbaar zijn.  

3.3 Oefening schip-verlaten 

3.3.1 Iedere oefening schip-verlaten moet omvatten: 

.1 het oproepen van passagiers en bemanning naar hun verzamelplaatsen door middel van het alarmsysteem vereist in voorschrift 6.4.2, gevolgd door een aankondiging van de oefening via het scheepsomroepsysteem of een ander communicatiesysteem en het zich ervan verzekeren dat zij op de hoogte zijn gebracht van de gang van zaken bij het schip-verlaten, zoals vermeld in de verlaatrol;  

.2 het melden bij de verzamelplaatsen en het voorbereiden op de taken genoemd in de verlaatrol;  

.3 controle op de passende kleding van passagiers en bemanning;  

.4 controle of de reddingsgordels goed zijn aangetrokken;  

.5 het afvieren van ten minste één reddingsboot nadat deze voor het afvieren gereed is gemaakt;  

.6 het starten en laten draaien van de reddingsbootmotor;  

.7 het bedienen van de kranen voor de strijkbare reddingsvlotten;  

.8 een oefening met het opsporen en redden van passagiers die vastzitten in hun hutten; en  

.9 instructies voor het gebruik van radiomiddelen voor redding.    

3.3.2 Voor zover uitvoerbaar moeten bij achtereenvolgende oefeningen verschillende reddingsboten worden afgevierd overeenkomstig het bepaalde in paragraaf 3.3.1.5.  

3.3.3 Behalve in situaties omschreven in de paragrafen 3.3.4 en 3.3.5, moet iedere reddingsboot ten minste eenmaal in de drie maanden tijdens een verlaatrol door de voor de bediening aangewezen bemanning aan boord te water worden gelaten en moet er mee worden gemanoeuvreerd.  

3.3.4 In het geval van een reddingsboot die bedoeld is voor tewaterlating door middel van vrije val, gaat de bemanning, tenminste eenmaal per kwartaal tijdens een ontruimingsoefening aan boord van de reddingsboot, bevestigt zich naar behoren op de zitplaats en vangt aan met de procedure voor tewaterlating tot aan, niet tot en met, de feitelijke loskoppeling van de reddingsboot (de ontkoppelingshaak mag niet worden losgemaakt). De reddingsboot wordt vervolgens hetzij door middel van vrije val te water gelaten met uitsluitend de voor de bediening benodigde bemanning aan boord, of door middel van een secundaire voorziening voor tewaterlating in het water geplaatst met of zonder de bemanning voor de bediening aan boord. In beide gevallen moet vervolgens met de reddingsboot door de bemanning voor de bediening in het water worden gemanoeuvreerd. Met tussenpozen van ten hoogste zes maanden moet de reddingsboot hetzij door middel van vrije val te water worden gelaten met uitsluitend de bemanning voor de bediening aan boord, of moet een gesimuleerde tewaterlating plaatsvinden in overeenstemming met de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren . <sup> 2)  Zie de Maatregelen ter voorkoming van ongevallen met reddingsboten (MSC.1/Circ.1206).  </sup>  

3.3.5 Voor schepen die korte internationale reizen maken kan de Administratie toestaan om de reddingsboten aan één zijde niet te water te laten wanneer de ligplaatsvoorzieningen in de haven en het vaarpatroon het te water laten aan die zijde niet mogelijk maken. Al deze reddingsboten moeten echter ten minste eenmaal per drie maanden afgevierd en jaarlijks te water gelaten worden.  

3.3.6 Voor zover dat redelijk en uitvoerbaar is moeten hulpverleningsboten, anders dan reddingsboten die tevens hulpverleningsboten zijn, iedere maand met hun aangewezen bemanning te water worden gelaten en moet er mee worden gemanoeuvreerd in het water. In ieder geval moet ten minste eenmaal in de drie maanden aan deze eis worden voldaan.  

3.3.7 Indien oefeningen met het te water laten van de reddingsboot en hulpverleningsboot worden gehouden met een vaartlopend schip, dan moeten deze oefeningen in verband met de gevaren die daaraan verbonden zijn uitsluitend worden uitgevoerd in beschut water en onder toezicht staan van een officier met ervaring in dergelijke oefeningen.  

3.3.8 Indien een schip is uitgerust met mariene evacuatiesystemen, moeten de oefeningen de uitvoering van de procedures omvatten voor het gebruik van een dergelijk systeem tot aan het moment dat direct voorafgaat aan het daadwerkelijk gebruik van het systeem. Dit aspect van oefeningen moet worden aangevuld met regelmatige instructies met behulp van de hulpmiddelen voor oefeningen aan boord vereist in voorschrift 35.4. Bovendien moet elk lid van de bemanning van het systeem, voor zover uitvoerbaar, verder worden getraind door middel van deelname in een oefening waarbij een vergelijkbaar systeem volledig wordt gebruikt in het water, hetzij aan boord van een schip hetzij op de wal, met tussenpozen van niet langer dan twee jaar, maar in geen geval langer dan drie jaar. Deze training kan worden gecombineerd met de oefeningen vereist in voorschrift 20.8.2.

### Voorschrift  5  

####Meteorologische diensten en waarschuwingen

1 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verbinden zich ertoe het verzamelen van meteorologische gegevens door schepen op zee te bevorderen en deze gegevens te doen onderzoeken, verspreiden en uitwisselen op de wijze die het meest beantwoordt aan het doel de navigatie te ondersteunen. Administraties moeten het gebruik van instrumenten met hoge graad van nauwkeurigheid bevorderen en het ijken van zulke instrumenten, wanneer hierom wordt verzocht, vergemakkelijken. De desbetreffende nationale meteorologische diensten kunnen regelingen treffen om deze ijkingen, zonder kosten voor het schip, te doen uitvoeren.  

2 In het bijzonder verbinden de Verdragsluitende Regeringen zich ertoe samen te werken bij het uitvoeren van de volgende meteorologische regelingen: 

.1 door middel van de verstrekking van gegevens in tekst en, voor zover uitvoerbaar, in grafische vorm, met gebruikmaking van de relevante voorzieningen aan land voor grondgebonden en ruimteradiocommunicatiediensten, schepen te waarschuwen omtrent harde wind, stormen en tropische stormen.  

.2 ten minste tweemaal daags via radiocommunicatiediensten aan land en in de ruimte, naar gelang van toepassing, voor de scheepvaart bruikbare weerberichten uit te zenden, bevattende gegevens, analyses, waarschuwingen en verwachtingen omtrent de gesteldheid van weer, zee en ijs. Deze informatie moet in de vorm van tekst worden verzonden en, voor zover uitvoerbaar, in grafische vorm, met inbegrip van via een fax of in digitale vorm verzonden meteorologische analyses en prognosekaarten, ter verwerking door het gegevensverwerkingssysteem aan boord.  

.3 publicaties te doen opstellen en uitgeven die nodig kunnen zijn voor een goede uitvoering van het meteorologische werk op zee en, indien mogelijk, regelingen te treffen voor het uitgeven en beschikbaar stellen van dagelijkse weerkaarten ter voorlichting van vertrekkende schepen.  

.4 regelingen te treffen, opdat de schepen geselecteerd voor het verrichten van meteorologische waarnemingen worden voorzien van geverifieerde instrumenten (zoals een barometer, een barograaf, een psychrometer, en van doelmatige middelen voor het meten van de temperatuur van het zeewater) en dat de meteorologische waarnemingen worden verricht op de hoofdstandaarduren die voor synoptische waarnemingen aan het aardoppervlak zijn vastgesteld (ten minste viermaal daags, wanneer de omstandigheden dit toelaten); en te bevorderen dat andere schepen waarnemingen op bescheidener schaal doen, in het bijzonder in gebieden waar weinig scheepvaartverkeer is.  

.5 maatschappijen aan te moedigen zo veel mogelijk van hun schepen te betrekken bij het maken en vastleggen van weerswaarnemingen; deze waarnemingen moeten worden verzonden via de grondgebonden of ruimteradiocommunicatiemiddelen van het schip ten behoeve van de verschillende nationale meteorologische diensten.  

.6 de verzending van deze weerswaarnemingen is voor de betrokken schepen kosteloos.  

.7 schepen moet worden aanbevolen om, indien zij zich in de buurt van een tropische storm of van een vermoede tropische storm bevinden, wanneer de omstandigheden zulks toelaten, met kortere tussenpozen waarnemingen te doen en door te geven, met begrip voor het feit dat scheepsofficieren gedurende stormweer geheel door werk ten behoeve van de navigatie in beslag genomen kunnen zijn.  

.8 te zorgen voor de ontvangst en verzending van weersberichten van en naar schepen, met gebruikmaking van de relevante voorzieningen aan land voor grondgebonden en ruimteradiocommunicatiediensten.  

.9 kapiteins aan te moedigen schepen in de omgeving en ook walstations in te lichten wanneer zij windsnelheden van 50 zeemijlen of meer (kracht 10 volgens de schaal van Beaufort) ondervinden.  

.10 te trachten een eenvormige werkwijze van de eerder genoemde internationale meteorologische diensten te bereiken en, voor zover praktisch mogelijk, zich te houden aan de technische voorschriften en aanbevelingen, opgesteld door de Wereld Meteorologische Organisatie, tot welke de Verdragsluitende Regeringen zich kunnen wenden voor de bestudering van en het verkrijgen van advies over elk meteorologisch vraagstuk, dat zich bij het uitvoeren van dit Verdrag kan voordoen.    

3 De in dit voorschrift bedoelde informatie moet worden verstrekt in de voor uitzending vastgestelde vorm en worden uitgezonden in de volgorde van voorrang, voorgeschreven in het Radioreglement. Gedurende de uitzending „aan alle stations’’ van meteorologische berichten, weersverwachtingen en waarschuwingen, moeten alle scheepsstations handelen als in het Radioreglement is voorgeschreven.  

4 Weersverwachtingen, waarschuwingen, synoptische en andere meteorologische gegevens, bestemd voor schepen, moeten worden opgesteld en verspreid door de nationale meteorologische dienst die het gunstigst gelegen is om de verschillende kust- en volle-zeegebieden te bedienen, een en ander overeenkomstig de tussen de betrokken Verdragsluitende Regeringen onderling gemaakte afspraken, in het bijzonder als bedoeld in het Systeem - van de Wereld Meteorologische Organisatie - voor de opstelling en verspreiding van meteorologische verwachtingen en waarschuwingen op volle zee, krachtens het Wereldomvattend Maritiem Nood- en Veiligheidssysteem (GMDSS).    

### Voorschrift  6  

####IJspatrouilledienst

1 De IJspatrouilledienst draagt bij tot de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, een veilige en efficiënte navigatie en de bescherming van het mariene milieu in het Noord-Atlantisch gebied. Schepen die gebieden doorvaren waar ijsbergen kunnen voorkomen, die door de IJspatrouilledienst in het ijsseizoen worden bewaakt, zijn verplicht van de diensten van de IJspatrouilledienst gebruik te maken.  

2 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verplichten zich ertoe een ijspatrouilledienst en een dienst voor de bestudering en het waarnemen van de ijstoestand op de Noord-Atlantische Oceaan in stand te houden. Gedurende het gehele ijsseizoen – dat wil zeggen het tijdvak van 15 februari tot 1 juli in elk jaar - moeten de zuidoostelijke, zuidelijke en zuidwestelijke grenzen van het gebied waar ijsbergen kunnen voorkomen, in de omgeving van de Grote Banken van Newfoundland worden bewaakt teneinde passerende schepen in te lichten omtrent de uitgestrektheid van dit gevaarlijke gebied, de ijstoestanden in algemene zin te bestuderen en aan schepen en bemanningen die in het operatiegebied van de patrouilleschepen en vliegtuigen hulp nodig hebben, bijstand te verlenen. Gedurende het overige gedeelte van het jaar moeten, al naargelang zulks raadzaam is, de bestudering en waarneming van de ijstoestanden worden voortgezet.  

3 Schepen en vliegtuigen die voor de ijspatrouilledienst en de bestudering en waarneming van het ijs worden gebruikt, mogen met andere werkzaamheden worden belast, onder voorwaarde dat deze andere werkzaamheden geen belemmering voor de primaire taak vormen en de kosten van de dienst niet verhogen.  

4 De Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika verbindt zich ertoe het algehele beheer van de IJspatrouilledienst en de bestudering en waarneming van ijstoestanden, alsmede de verspreiding van de daaruit verkregen gegevens, voort te zetten.  

5 De voorwaarden voor het beheer, de exploitatie en de financiering van de IJspatrouilledienst zijn vervat in de Regels voor het beheer, de exploitatie en de financiering van de IJspatrouilledienst op de Noord-Atlantische Oceaan, die aan dit hoofdstuk zijn gehecht en hiervan een integrerend onderdeel vormen.  

6 Indien de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en/of Canada te eniger tijd deze diensten zou wensen te beëindigen, kan zij dit doen en moeten de Verdragsluitende Regeringen de aangelegenheid in overeenstemming met hun wederzijdse belangen regelen. Alvorens deze diensten te beëindigen moet de Regering van de Verenigde Staten en/of Canada een schriftelijke kennisgeving met een opzegtermijn van 18 maanden doen aan alle Verdragsluitende Regeringen wier schepen onder hun vlag mogen varen en wier schepen die zijn geregistreerd in gebieden op welke de Verdragsluitende Regeringen de werking van dit voorschrift toepassen, van deze diensten gebruik maken.    

### Voorschrift  7  

####Opsporings- en reddingsdiensten

1 Elke Verdragsluitende Regering verbindt zich ertoe ervoor zorg te dragen, dat alle noodzakelijke maatregelen worden getroffen voor noodcommunicatie en –coördinatie in haar gebied van verantwoordelijkheid en voor het redden van personen die op zee nabij haar kusten in nood verkeren. Deze maatregelen moeten de vestiging, het gebruik en het onderhoud van die opsporings- en reddingsmiddelen omvatten, welke, gelet op de omvang van het verkeer ter zee en de gevaren voor de navigatie, praktisch uitvoerbaar en nodig geacht worden en moeten, zoveel als mogelijk is, voorzien in doeltreffende middelen voor het opsporen en redden van bedoelde personen.  

2 Elke Verdragsluitende Regering verbindt zich ertoe gegevens aan de Organisatie te verstrekken betreffende de in haar land aanwezige opsporings- en reddingsfaciliteiten en de plannen voor eventueel daarin aan te brengen wijzigingen.

1 Routeringssystemen voor schepen dragen bij tot de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, de veiligheid en doelmatigheid van de navigatie en/of de bescherming van het mariene milieu. Het gebruik van routeringssystemen voor schepen wordt aanbevolen en kan verplicht worden gesteld voor alle schepen, bepaalde categorieën schepen of schepen die een bepaalde lading vervoeren, mits die systemen worden aangenomen en geïmplementeerd in overeenstemming met de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria.  

2 De Organisatie wordt erkend als het enige internationale orgaan dat op internationaal niveau richtlijnen, criteria en voorschriften kan opstellen betreffende routeringssystemen voor schepen. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen doen voorstellen voor de aanvaarding van routeringssystemen voor schepen toekomen aan de Organisatie. De Organisatie verzamelt alle van belang zijnde gegevens betreffende alle routeringssystemen voor schepen die zijn aangenomen en brengt deze ter kennis van de Verdragsluitende Regeringen.  

3 Het initiatief voor het nemen van maatregelen ten behoeve van het vaststellen van een routeringssysteem voor schepen valt onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de betrokken Regering of Regeringen. Bij het ontwikkelen van genoemde systemen ter aanvaarding door de Organisatie, moet met de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria rekening worden gehouden.  

4 Routeringssystemen voor schepen worden aan de Organisatie voorgelegd ter aanneming. Een Regering of Regeringen die routeringssystemen voor schepen implementeren niet bedoeld om aan de Organisatie ter aanneming te worden voorgelegd, of die niet door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen, worden evenwel aangemoedigd, zo veel mogelijk, met de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria rekening te houden.  

5 Indien twee of meer Regeringen een gemeenschappelijk belang hebben in een bepaald gebied, formuleren zij gezamenlijke voorstellen voor de afbakening en het gebruik van een routeringssysteem in het desbetreffende gebied op basis van een onderlinge overeenkomst. Na ontvangst van een dergelijk voorstel en alvorens over te gaan tot de bestudering ervan met het oog op aanneming, zorgt de Organisatie dat het uitgewerkte voorstel wordt verspreid onder de Regeringen die een gemeenschappelijk belang in het gebied hebben, met inbegrip van landen die in de nabijheid van het voorgestelde routeringssysteem voor schepen liggen.  

6 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen leven de door de Organisatie aanvaarde maatregelen betreffende de routeringssystemen voor schepen na. Zij verspreiden alle inlichtingen die nodig zijn voor een veilig en doeltreffend gebruik van de aanvaarde routeringssystemen voor schepen. De desbetreffende Regering of Regeringen mogen de schepen die deze systemen gebruiken, volgen. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen doen alles wat in hun vermogen ligt om een passend gebruik van de door de Organisatie aanvaarde routeringssystemen voor schepen te garanderen.  

7 Een schip dient gebruik te maken van een verplicht door de Organisatie aanvaard routeringssysteem voor schepen zoals is vereist voor de categorie waarin het schip valt of voor de vervoerde lading, en in overeenstemming met de desbetreffende van kracht zijnde bepalingen, tenzij er dwingende redenen zijn een bepaald routeringssysteem voor schepen niet te gebruiken. Deze redenen moeten worden vermeld in het logboek van het schip.  

8 Verplichte routeringssystemen voor schepen worden door de Verdragsluitende Regering of Regeringen herzien overeenkomstig de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria.  

9 Alle aanvaarde routeringssystemen voor schepen en maatregelen getroffen teneinde op de naleving ervan toe te zien, moeten in overeenstemming zijn met het internationale recht, met inbegrip van de desbetreffende bepalingen van het [Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties inzake het recht van de zee, 1982](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/united/nations/convention/on/the/law/of/the/sea/BWBV0003172/README.md).  

10 Niets in dit voorschrift of in de bijbehorende richtlijnen en criteria doet afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen van Regeringen uit hoofde van het internationaal recht of juridische stelsel van zeestraten die voor internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt en zeeroutes bij archipellen.    

### Voorschrift  11  

####Meldingssystemen voor schepen

1 Meldingssystemen voor schepen dragen bij tot de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, de veiligheid en doelmatigheid van de navigatie en/of de bescherming van het mariene milieu. Na aanneming en toepassing ervan in overeenstemming met de door de Organisatie conform dit voorschrift opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria, moet een meldingssysteem voor schepen door alle schepen worden gebruikt, of door bepaalde categorieën schepen of door schepen die een bepaalde lading vervoeren, in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van elk aldus aangenomen systeem.  

2 De Organisatie wordt erkend als het enige internationale lichaam voor het ontwikkelen van richtlijnen, criteria en voorschriften op internationaal niveau voor meldingssystemen voor schepen. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen doen voorstellen voor de aanvaarding van meldingssystemen voor schepen toekomen aan de Organisatie. De Organisatie verzamelt en verspreidt alle relevante informatie ter zake van elk aangenomen meldingssysteem voor schepen onder de Verdragsluitende Regeringen.  

3 Het initiatief voor het nemen van maatregelen ten behoeve van het vaststellen van een meldingssysteem voor schepen valt onder de verantwoordelijkheid van de betrokken Regering of Regeringen. Bij het ontwikkelen van meldingssystemen voor schepen moet rekening worden gehouden met de bepalingen van de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria.  

4 Meldingssystemen voor schepen die niet ter aanneming aan de Organisatie worden voorgelegd, behoeven niet noodzakelijkerwijs aan dit voorschrift te voldoen. Regeringen die een meldingssysteem voor schepen ontwikkelen worden echter aangemoedigd, zo veel mogelijk de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria na te leven. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen kunnen dergelijke systemen aan de Organisatie voorleggen voor erkenning.  

5 Wanneer twee of meer Regeringen in een bepaald gebied een gemeenschappelijk belang hebben, moeten zij voorstellen formuleren voor een gezamenlijk meldingssysteem voor schepen op basis van een onderlinge overeenkomst. Alvorens over te gaan tot de behandeling van een voorstel ter aanneming van een meldingssysteem voor schepen, verspreidt de Organisatie nadere gegevens betreffende het voorstel onder de Regeringen die een gemeenschappelijk belang hebben in het gebied waarop het voorgestelde systeem betrekking heeft. Wanneer een gezamenlijk meldingssysteem voor schepen wordt aangenomen en ingevoerd, moeten daarvoor gelijke procedures en bedieningswijzen gelden.  

6 Na aanneming van een meldingssysteem voor schepen in overeenstemming met dit voorschrift, moet de betrokken Regering of moeten de betrokken Regeringen alle nodige maatregelen nemen voor de verspreiding van alle benodigde informatie voor een doelmatige en doeltreffende werking van het systeem. Alle aangenomen meldingssystemen moeten met elkaar kunnen communiceren en de mogelijkheid bieden schepen indien nodig bij te staan door het verstrekken van informatie. Bedoelde systemen moeten worden geëxploiteerd in overeenstemming met de richtlijnen en criteria die door de Organisatie overeenkomstig dit voorschrift zijn opgesteld.  

7 De kapitein van een schip dient de voorschriften van aangenomen meldingssystemen voor schepen na te leven en alle informatie die in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van elk van deze systemen is vereist, te rapporteren aan de bevoegde autoriteit.  

8 Alle aangenomen meldingssystemen en maatregelen die worden genomen om naleving van deze systemen te bewerkstelligen, dienen in overeenstemming te zijn met het internationale recht, in het bijzonder met de relevante bepalingen van het [Verdrag van de Verenigde Naties inzake het recht van de zee](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/united/nations/convention/on/the/law/of/the/sea/BWBV0003172/README.md).  

9 Niets in dit voorschrift of in de bijbehorende richtlijnen en criteria doet afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen van Regeringen uit hoofde van het internationaal recht of juridische stelsel van zeestraten die voor internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt en zeeroutes bij archipellen.  

10 Aan deelname van schepen in overeenstemming met de bepalingen van aangenomen meldingssystemen voor schepen mogen voor de betrokken schepen geen kosten verbonden zijn.  

11 De Organisatie draagt er zorg voor dat aangenomen meldingssystemen voor schepen worden beoordeeld aan de hand van de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en criteria.    

### Voorschrift  12  

####Verkeersbegeleidingssystemen

1 Verkeersbegeleidingssystemen (Vessel Traffic Services,VTS) leveren een bijdrage aan de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, de veiligheid en doeltreffendheid van de navigatie en aan de bescherming van het mariene milieu, van aangrenzende kustgebieden, werklocaties en offshore-installaties tegen de mogelijk schadelijke gevolgen van scheepvaartverkeer op zee.  

2 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verplichten zich ertoe VTS in te stellen waar, naar hun mening, de verkeersdichtheid of het risiconiveau een dergelijk systeem rechtvaardigen.  

3 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen die VTS plannen en implementeren, volgen, overal waar dit mogelijk is, de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen. Het gebruik van VTS kan uitsluitend verplicht worden gesteld in zeegebieden binnen de territoriale zeeën van een kuststaat.  

4 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen zetten zich ervoor in om de deelname aan en naleving van de bepalingen van verkeersbegeleidende systemen door schepen die hun vlag mogen voeren, te waarborgen.  

5 Niets in dit voorschrift of in de door de Organisatie aangenomen richtlijnen doet afbreuk aan de rechten en verplichtingen van Regeringen uit hoofde van het internationaal recht of juridische stelsel van zeestraten die voor internationale scheepvaart worden gebruikt en zeeroutes bij archipellen.    

### Voorschrift  13  

####Plaatsen en onderhouden van hulpmiddelen voor de navigatie

1 Elke Verdragsluitende Regering verbindt zich ertoe, voor zover zij dit uitvoerbaar en nodig acht, hetzij individueel, hetzij in samenwerking met andere Verdragsluitende Regeringen zorg te dragen voor het plaatsen en onderhouden van die hulpmiddelen voor de navigatie, welke naar haar oordeel door de omvang van het verkeer worden gewettigd en door de mate van gevaar nodig zijn.  

2 Teneinde een zo groot mogelijke uniformiteit van de hulpmiddelen voor de navigatie te verkrijgen, verplichten de Verdragsluitende Regeringen zich ertoe bij de plaatsing van dergelijke hulpmiddelen rekening te houden met de internationale aanbevelingen en richtlijnen.  

3 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verbinden zich ertoe zorg te dragen voor het ter beschikking stellen van informatie met betrekking tot hulpmiddelen aan alle belanghebbenden. Veranderingen in de uitzendingen van plaatsbepalingssystemen die de werking van de aan boord van schepen geïnstalleerde ontvangers nadelig zouden kunnen beïnvloeden, moeten voor zover mogelijk worden voorkomen en uitsluitend worden doorgevoerd na tijdige en deugdelijke kennisgeving.    

### Voorschrift  14  

####Bemanning van schepen

1 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen verbinden zich ertoe, ieder voor haar nationale schepen, maatregelen in stand te houden of deze zonodig te nemen om te verzekeren dat, uit oogpunt van veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee, alle schepen voldoende bemand zijn met voor zijn taak berekend personeel.  

2 Elk schip waarop hoofdstuk I van toepassing is, moet zijn voorzien van een passend document inzake de voor de veiligheid benodigde bemanning, of een gelijkwaardig document afgegeven door de Administratie, waaruit blijkt dat de minimum-veiligheidsbemanning aan boord is die noodzakelijk wordt geacht om te voldoen aan het in paragraaf 1 bepaalde.  

3 Op alle schepen moet ter waarborging van het doeltreffende optreden van de bemanning op het gebied van de veiligheid, een werktaal worden vastgesteld en vermeld in het logboek van het schip. De maatschappij, als omschreven in voorschrift IX/1, of de kapitein, naar gelang van toepassing, stelt de werktaal vast. Elke zeevarende wordt geacht deze taal te begrijpen en, in voorkomend geval, in deze taal orders en instructies te geven en verslag uit te brengen. Indien de werktaal niet een officiële taal is van het land waarvan het schip bevoegd is de vlag te voeren, moeten alle plattegronden en lijsten die moeten worden opgehangen, zijn voorzien van een vertaling in de werktaal.  

4 Op schepen waarop hoofdstuk I van toepassing is, moet op de brug Engels als werktaal worden gebruikt voor brug-naar-brug en brug-naar-wal veiligheidsberichten, alsmede voor de communicatie aan boord tussen de loods en het wachtlopende personeel op de brug, tenzij de rechtstreeks bij de communicatie betrokken personen een gemeenschappelijke taal spreken, anders dan het Engels.    

### Voorschrift  15  

####Beginselen met betrekking tot het ontwerp van de brug, het ontwerp en de opstelling van navigatiesystemen en -apparatuur en brugprocedures

Bij alle besluiten die worden genomen voor de toepassing van de vereisten van de voorschriften 19, 22, 24, 25, 27 en 28 en die van invloed zijn op het ontwerp van de brug, het ontwerp en de opstelling van navigatiesystemen en -apparatuur op de brug en op brugprocedures, moeten de volgende doelen voor ogen worden gehouden: 

.1 het vergemakkelijken van de taken van het brugteam en de loods bij het maken van een volledige beoordeling van de situatie en bij het onder alle operationele omstandigheden veilig besturen van het schip;  

.2 het bevorderen van een doeltreffende en veilige brugorganisatie;  

.3 het zorgen voor gemakkelijke en permanente toegang van het brugteam en de loods tot essentiële informatie die op duidelijke en eenduidige wijze wordt gepresenteerd, met gebruikmaking van standaard symbolen en coderingssystemen voor bedienings- en presentatiemiddelen;  

.4 het aanduiden van de operationele status van geautomatiseerde functies en geïntegreerde componenten, systemen en/of subsystemen;  

.5 het mogelijk maken van snelle, permanente en doeltreffende informatieverwerking en besluitvorming door het brugteam en de loods;  

.6 het voorkomen of tot een minimum beperken van teveel of onnodige werkzaamheden en van omstandigheden of afleiding op de brug die vermoeidheid kunnen veroorzaken of waardoor de waakzaamheid van het brugteam en de loods verslapt; en  

.7 het tot een minimum beperken van de kans op menselijke fouten en het tijdig ontdekken van dergelijke fouten wanneer deze toch worden gemaakt, door middel van monitoring- en alarmsystemen, zodat het brugteam en de loods tijdig passende maatregelen kunnen treffen.    

### Voorschrift  16  

####Onderhoud van uitrusting

1 Ten genoegen van de Administratie moet worden aangetoond dat voldoende maatregelen zijn getroffen om ervoor te zorgen dat de in dit hoofdstuk vereiste uitrusting in goede staat wordt gehouden.  

2 Hoewel alle redelijke maatregelen moeten worden genomen om de in dit hoofdstuk vereiste uitrusting in goede staat te houden, moet, behoudens het bepaalde in de voorschriften I/7(b) (ii), I/8 en I/9, storing in deze uitrusting niet worden beschouwd als reden waarom het schip onzeewaardig zou zijn of als reden om het schip op te houden in havens waar binnen redelijke tijd geen mogelijkheden voor reparatie beschikbaar zijn, mits door de kapitein passende maatregelen worden getroffen om met de defecte uitrusting of onbeschikbare informatie rekening te houden bij de voorbereiding en uitvoering van een veilige reis naar een haven waar reparatie kan plaatsvinden.    

### Voorschrift  17  

####Elektromagnetische compatibiliteit

1 Administraties moeten erop toezien dat alle elektrische en elektronische apparatuur op de brug of in de nabijheid van de brug, op schepen gebouwd na 1 juli 2002, wordt beproefd op elektromagnetische compatibiliteit, met inachtneming van de door de Organisatie opgestelde aanbevelingen.  

2 Elektrische en elektronische apparatuur moet zodanig worden geïnstalleerd dat de elektromagnetische interferentie de goede werking van de navigatiesystemen en -apparatuur niet aantast.  

3 Draagbare elektrische en elektronische apparatuur mag niet op de brug worden gebruikt indien hierdoor de goede werking van de navigatiesystemen en -apparatuur kan worden aangetast.    

### Voorschrift  18  

####Goedkeuring, onderzoek en uitvoeringsnormen van navigatiesystemen en -apparatuur en van de reisgegevensrecorder

1.  Systemen en apparatuur die moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van de voorschriften 19 en 20 moeten van een door de Administratie goedgekeurd type zijn.   
2.  Systemen en apparatuur en, in voorkomend geval, de bijbehorende back-up voorzieningen, op of na 1 juli 2002 geïnstalleerd om te voldoen aan de functionele vereisten van de voorschriften 19 en 20, moeten aan uitvoeringsnormen voldoen die ten minste gelijk zijn aan die welke door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen.   
3.  Wanneer systemen en apparatuur op schepen gebouwd vóór 1 juli 2002 worden vervangen of toegevoegd, moeten deze systemen en apparatuur, voor zover redelijk en uitvoerbaar, voldoen aan de vereisten van paragraaf 2.   
4.  Systemen en apparatuur geïnstalleerd voordat de desbetreffende uitvoeringsnormen door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen, kunnen vervolgens, wanneer het de Administratie goeddunkt, worden vrijgesteld van het volledig voldoen aan die normen, waarbij terdege rekening moet worden gehouden met de aanbevolen criteria die door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen. Voordat een elektronische zeekaart presentatie en informatiesysteem (ECDIS) kan worden aanvaard als beantwoordend aan het vereiste van voorschrift 19.2.1.4 inzake het aan boord hebben van kaarten, moet dat systeem voldoen aan uitvoeringsnormen die niet lager zijn dan die welke door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen en op de datum van installatie van kracht zijn, of, voor systemen geïnstalleerd vóór 1 januari 1999, niet lager zijn dan de door de Organisatie op 23 november 1995 aangenomen uitvoeringsnormen.   
5.  De Administratie moet verlangen dat de fabrikanten een kwaliteitscontrolesysteem hebben dat door een bevoegde instantie wordt geaudit om de voortdurende naleving van de typegoedkeuringsvereisten te waarborgen. Als alternatief kan de Administratie procedures voor de controle van het eindproduct hanteren, waarbij de conformiteit van het typegoedkeuringscertificaat door een bevoegde instantie wordt gecontroleerd voordat het product aan boord van een schip wordt geïnstalleerd.   
6.  Voordat goedkeuring wordt verleend aan systemen of apparatuur met nieuwe eigenschappen waarin dit hoofdstuk niet voorziet, moet de Administratie erop toezien dat deze eigenschappen functies ondersteunen die ten minste zo doeltreffend zijn als die welke ingevolge dit hoofdstuk vereist zijn.   
7.  Wanneer aan boord van schepen naast de in de voorschriften 19 en 20 vereiste uitrusting apparatuur aanwezig is waarvoor door de Organisatie uitvoeringseisen zijn opgesteld, moet deze apparatuur worden goedgekeurd en, voor zover praktisch uitvoerbaar, voldoen aan uitvoeringsnormen die niet lager zijn dan die welke door de Organisatie zijn aangenomen.   
8.  Het VDR-systeem, met inbegrip van alle sensors, moet aan een jaarlijkse werkingsbeproeving worden onderworpen. De beproeving moet worden uitgevoerd door een goedgekeurd beproevings- of onderhoudsstation teneinde de nauwkeurigheid, de levensduur en de herstelbaarheid van de opgeslagen gegevens te controleren. Daarnaast moeten beproevingen en inspecties worden uitgevoerd om vast te stellen in hoeverre alle beschermende behuizingen en plaatsbepalingsvoorzieningen kunnen worden onderhouden. Aan boord moet een afschrift aanwezig zijn van het door het beproevingsstation afgegeven conformiteitscertificaat, met vermelding van de geldigheidsdatum en de desbetreffende uitvoeringsnormen.   
9.  Het automatisch identificatiesysteem (AIS) moet aan een jaarlijkse beproeving worden onderworpen. De beproeving moet worden uitgevoerd door een erkende inspecteur of door een erkende test- of onderhoudsfaciliteit. Bij de beproeving wordt gecontroleerd of de statische informatie van het schip correct geprogrammeerd is en of er een correcte gegevensuitwisseling met de aangesloten sensoren is. Daarnaast worden de radiofuncties gecontroleerd door middel van radiofrequentiemetingen en een „live” test, bijvoorbeeld door een verkeersbegeleidingssysteem (VBS) te gebruiken. Aan boord moet een afschrift van het beproevingsrapport aanwezig zijn.

1.2 Uitrusting en voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods die worden aangebracht op of na 1 juli 2012 moeten voldoen aan de vereisten van dit voorschrift, en er moet naar behoren rekening worden gehouden met de door de Organisatie aangenomen normen. <sup> 1)  Zie de Eenduidige Interpretatie van SOLAS-voorschrift V/23 (MSC.1/Circ.1375).  </sup> <sup> 2)  Zie de resolutie van de Algemene Vergadering over voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods, aan te nemen door de Organisatie.  </sup>  

1.3 Behoudens waar anders wordt bepaald moeten uitrusting en voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods die op schepen worden aangebracht vóór 1 juli 2012 ten minste voldoen aan de vereisten van voorschrift 17 of 23, al naargelang van toepassing, van het Internationaal Verdrag voor de beveiliging van mensenlevens op zee, 1974, zoals van kracht tot die datum, en er moet naar behoren rekening worden gehouden met de voorafgaand aan die datum door de Organisatie aangenomen normen. <sup> 3)  Zie resolutie MSC.99(73) waarin het voorgaande voorschrift 17 werd omgenummerd tot voorschrift 23, dat op 1 juli 2002 in werking trad.  </sup>  

1.4 Uitrusting en voorzieningen die op of na 1 juli 2012 worden aangebracht en een vervanging zijn van uitrusting en voorzieningen die vóór 1 juli 2012 op schepen zijn aangebracht, moeten, voor zover redelijk en uitvoerbaar, voldoen aan de vereisten van dit voorschrift.  

1.5 Paragraaf 5 is uiterlijk bij het eerste onderzoek op of na 1 juli 2012 van toepassing op schepen gebouwd vóór 1 januari 1994. <sup> 4)  Zie de Eenduidige Interpretatie van de term „eerste onderzoek” waarnaar verwezen wordt in SOLAS-voorschriften (MSC.1/Circ.1290).  </sup>  

1.6 Paragraaf 6 is op alle schepen van toepassing.    

2. Algemeen 

2.1 Alle voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods moeten loodsen op doelmatige wijze in staat stellen veilig aan en van boord te gaan. De voorzieningen moeten worden schoongehouden, op de juiste wijze worden onderhouden en geborgen, en geregeld worden geïnspecteerd om te verzekeren dat ze veilig zijn in het gebruik. Ze mogen uitsluitend worden gebruikt voor het aan en van boord gaan van personeel.  

2.2 Het optuigen van de voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods en het aan boord gaan van de loods moeten geschieden onder toezicht van een verantwoordelijk officier die beschikt over middelen voor communicatie met de navigatiebrug, en die ook regelingen treft voor de begeleiding van de loods langs een veilige route naar en van de navigatiebrug. Personeel dat zich bezighoudt met het optuigen en de bediening van mechanische uitrusting moet worden geïnstrueerd in de te hanteren veilige procedures, en de uitrusting moet voor gebruik worden getest.  

2.3 Een loodsladder moet door de producent worden gecertificeerd als zijnde in overeenstemming met dit voorschrift of met een internationale norm die voor de Organisatie aanvaardbaar is. Ladders moeten worden geïnspecteerd in overeenstemming met de voorschriften I/6, 7 en 8. <sup> 5)  Zie de aanbevelingen van de Internationale Organisatie voor Normalisatie, in het bijzonder de publicatie ISO 799: 2004 – *Schepen en mariene technologie - loodsladders.*  </sup>  

2.4 Alle loodsladders die worden gebruikt voor het overnemen van loodsen moeten duidelijk worden gemarkeerd met labels of een andere permanente markering zodat elke loodsladder herkenbaar is ten behoeve van onderzoek, inspectie en registratie. Op het schip moet een journaal aanwezig zijn waarin melding wordt gemaakt van de datum waarop de desbetreffende ladder in gebruik is genomen alsmede eventuele uitgevoerde reparaties.  

2.5 Wanneer in dit voorschrift naar een valreep wordt verwezen wordt hierbij tevens een hellende ladder bedoeld die gebruikt wordt als onderdeel van de voorzieningen voor het overnemen van de loods.    

3. Voorzieningen voor het overnemen 

3.1 Er moeten voorzieningen zijn opdat de loods op veilige wijze aan en van boord kan gaan aan beide zijden van het schip.  

3.2 Op alle schepen waar de afstand van het wateroppervlak tot de plaats voor het aan of van boord gaan meer dan 9 m bedraagt, en waar loodsen worden geacht aan en van boord te gaan met behulp van de valreep of andere, even veilige en gemakkelijke middelen in combinatie met een loodsladder, moet het schip aan beide zijden van die uitrusting zijn voorzien, tenzij de uitrusting verplaatsbaar is voor gebruik aan beide zijden. <sup> 6)  Zie voorschrift II-1/3-9 inzake Middelen voor inscheping en ontscheping, aangenomen bij resolutie MSC.256(84), samen met de bijbehorende Richtlijnen (MSC.1/Circ.1331).  </sup>  

3.3 Voor het veilig en gemakkelijk aan en van boord gaan moet het schip zijn uitgerust met: 

.1 een loodsladder die een klim vereist van ten minste 1,5 m en ten hoogste 9 m boven het wateroppervlak, die zodanig is geplaatst en vastgezet dat: 

.1 deze vrijhangt van mogelijke spuipijpen van het schip;  

.2 deze evenwijdig aan het vlak van kiel en stevens en, voor zover uitvoerbaar, binnen een kwart scheepslengte vanuit de midscheeps hangt;  

.3 iedere trede stevig tegen de scheepshuid rust; indien speciale constructies, zoals bijvoorbeeld berghouten, de toepassing van deze bepaling verhinderen, moeten speciale regelingen worden getroffen ten genoegen van de Administratie teneinde te waarborgen dat personen veilig aan en van boord kunnen gaan;  

.4 met de enkele ladderlengte het water kan worden bereikt vanaf de plaats voor het aan of van boord gaan, en hierbij rekening wordt gehouden met alle beladingstoestanden van het schip, met kop- of stuurlast en met een slagzij naar de andere zijde van 15°; de bevestigingspunten, sluitingen en sjordraden moeten ten minste even sterk zijn als de zijgeleiders; of    

.2 een valreep in combinatie met de loodsladder (d.w.z. een gecombineerde voorziening), of een andere even veilige en gemakkelijke voorziening, wanneer de afstand van het wateroppervlak tot de plaats voor het aan boord gaan meer dan 9 m bedraagt. De valreep moet zodanig zijn geplaatst dat deze naar de achtersteven leidt. Wanneer de valreep gebruikt wordt, moeten er middelen worden aangebracht om het onderste platform van de valreep tegen de scheepshuid vast te zetten, teneinde te waarborgen dat het onderste gedeelte van de valreep en het onderste platform stevig tegen de scheepshuid worden gehouden, evenwijdig aan het vlak van kiel en stevens en, voor zover uitvoerbaar, binnen een kwart scheepslengte vanuit de midscheeps en vrij van alle spuipijpen. 

.1 wanneer gebruik wordt gemaakt van een gecombineerde voorziening om de loods toegang te geven, moeten er middelen worden aangebracht om de loodsladder en de handgeleidende touwen tegen de scheepshuid vast te zetten op een hoogte van in principe 1,5 m boven het onderste platform van de valreep. In geval van een gecombineerde voorziening waarbij gebruik wordt gemaakt van een valreep met een luik in het onderste platform (d.w.z. een inschepingsplatform) worden de loodsladder en de handgeleidende touwen door het luik opgetuigd naar de hoogte van de leuning boven het platform.        

4. Toegang tot het scheepsdek Er moeten voorzieningen aanwezig zijn om personen die aan of van boord gaan in staat te stellen veilig, gemakkelijk en ongehinderd over te stappen van het boveneinde van de loodsladder of van een valreep of ander middel naar het scheepsdek. Indien dit overstappen geschiedt door middel van: 

.1 een opening in het hekwerk of verschansing, moeten toereikende handgrepen zijn aangebracht;  

.2 een verschansingstrap, moeten twee rechtopstaande houvasten, die aan of nabij hun onderzijden alsmede op hoger gelegen punten stevig zijn bevestigd aan het schip. De verschansingstrap moet stevig aan het schip zijn bevestigd om omslaan te voorkomen.    

5. Deuren in de scheepszijde Deuren in de scheepszijde die worden gebruikt voor het overnemen van de loods mogen niet naar buiten openen.  

6. Mechanische loodsladders Er mag geen gebruik worden gemaakt van mechanische loodsladders.  

7. Bijbehorende uitrusting 

7.1 De volgende bijbehorende uitrusting moet bij de hand worden gehouden, klaar voor onmiddellijk gebruik bij het overstappen van personen: 

.1 twee handgeleidende touwen met een diameter van ten minste 28 mm en ten hoogste 32 mm, goed bevestigd aan het schip, indien de loods deze verlangt; handgeleidende touwen moeten aan het uiteinde bevestigd worden aan de ringplaat die op het dek bevestigd is en moeten gereed zijn voor gebruik wanneer de loods van boord gaat of op verzoek van de loods die aan boord wil gaan (de handgeleidende touwen moeten op de plaats voor het aan dek gaan tot de hoogte van de houvasten of de verschansingen reiken en vervolgens eindigen bij de ringplaat op het dek);  

.2 een reddingboei voorzien van een zelfontbrandend licht;  

.3 een hieuwlijn.    

7.2 Indien vereist ingevolge paragraaf 4 moeten houvasten en verschansingstrappen aanwezig zijn.    

8. Verlichting Er moet toereikende verlichting zijn om de overneemvoorzieningen buitenboord en de plaats aan dek waar een persoon aan of van boord gaat te verlichten.

### Voorschrift  28  

####Journaals van navigatie-activiteiten en dagelijkse verslaglegging

1.  Alle schepen die internationale reizen maken moeten aan boord een journaal bijhouden van navigatie-activiteiten en incidenten die van belang zijn voor een veilige navigatie, dat voldoende uitgebreid moet zijn om een volledig verslag van de reis te kunnen reconstrueren, met inachtneming van de door de Organisatie aangenomen aanbevelingen. Wanneer dergelijke informatie niet wordt bijgehouden in het logboek van het schip, moet deze in een andere, door de Administratie goedgekeurde vorm worden bijgehouden.   
2.  Elk schip met een brutotonnage van 500 ton of meer, dat internationale reizen maakt van meer dan 48 uur, dient, gedurende de gehele reis, een dagelijks verslag in bij de maatschappij als omschreven in voorschrift IX/1, die dit verslag en alle opvolgende verslagen bewaart. Dagelijkse verslagen mogen via elk middel worden verstuurd, mits ze zo snel mogelijk na de vaststelling van de in het verslag vermelde positie aan de maatschappij worden verstuurd. Het gebruik van geautomatiseerde systemen voor verslaglegging is toegestaan, mits deze een voorziening voor opname van de verzending bevatten en mits deze functies en interfaces met positiebepalingssystemen regelmatig door de kapitein van het schip worden geverifieerd. Het verslag moet het volgende bevatten: 

.1 de positie van het schip;  

.2 de koers en snelheid van het schip; en  

.3 gegevens omtrent interne of externe omstandigheden die van invloed zijn op de reis of op de normale veilige bedrijfsvoering van het schip.     

### Voorschrift  29

Een geïllustreerde lijst, waarin de reddingsseinen zijn beschreven, moet op elk schip waarop dit hoofdstuk van toepassing is ten behoeve van de officier van de wacht onmiddellijk voorhanden zijn. De seinen moeten worden gebruikt door schepen of personen in nood wanneer deze zich in verbinding stellen met reddingsstations, zeegaande reddingseenheden en vliegtuigen, bezig met opsporings- of reddingswerkzaamheden.  

### Voorschrift  30  

####Beperking ten aanzien van de exploitatie

1 Dit voorschrift is van toepassing op alle passagiersschepen waarop hoofdstuk I van toepassing is.  

2 Voordat een passagiersschip in dienst wordt genomen, moet een lijst met alle beperkingen met betrekking tot de exploitatie van het passagiersschip worden opgesteld, met inbegrip van ontheffingen van deze voorschriften, beperkingen in de vaargebieden, beperkingen vanwege het weer, beperkingen met betrekking tot de toestand van de zee of de toegestane lading, beperkingen ten aanzien van kop- of stuurlast, snelheid en andere beperkingen, hetzij opgelegd door de Administratie, hetzij vastgesteld tijdens de ontwerp- of bouwfase. Deze lijst, tezamen met alle andere nodige uitleg, moet worden vastgelegd in een document opgesteld in een voor de Administratie aanvaardbare vorm, dat aan boord op eenvoudige wijze door de kapitein kan worden geraadpleegd. De lijst moet worden bijgehouden. Indien de gebruikte taal het Engels noch het Frans is, moet de lijst in één van deze twee talen beschikbaar zijn.    

### Voorschrift  31  

####Gevaarberichten

1 De kapitein van elk schip dat gevaarlijk ijs, een gevaarlijk wrak of een ander onmiddellijk gevaar voor de scheepvaart, of een tropische storm ontmoet, of luchttemperaturen onder het vriespunt gepaard gaande met stormwinden, die zware ijsafzetting op de bovenbouw veroorzaken, of stormen met windkracht 10 of hoger volgens de schaal van Beaufort, waarvoor geen stormwaarschuwing werd ontvangen, ondervindt, is verplicht met alle hem ter beschikking staande middelen schepen in de omgeving waarmee hij verbinding kan krijgen alsmede de bevoegde autoriteiten daarvan op de hoogte te brengen. De vorm waarin de informatie wordt gegeven, is niet bindend voorgeschreven. De informatie mag worden uitgezonden hetzij in begrijpelijke taal (bij voorkeur Engels), hetzij met gebruikmaking van het Internationaal Seinboek.  

2 Elke Verdragsluitende Regering treft de nodige maatregelen opdat, wanneer bericht omtrent een gevaar als bedoeld in paragraaf 1 wordt ontvangen, dit dadelijk ter kennis van belanghebbenden wordt gebracht en wordt doorgezonden aan andere Regeringen die daarbij belang kunnen hebben.  

3 De overbrenging van berichten aangaande bedoelde gevaren is kosteloos voor de betrokken schepen.  

4 Alle radioberichten die ingevolge paragraaf 1 worden verzonden, moeten worden voorafgegaan door het veiligheidssein, waarbij de in het Radioreglement, genoemd in voorschrift IV/2, voorgeschreven procedure moet worden gevolgd.    

### Voorschrift  32  

####In gevaarberichten op te nemen informatie

Gevaarberichten moeten de volgende informatie bevatten: 

1 IJs, wrakken of andere directe gevaren voor de navigatie: 

.1 De soort van het waargenomen ijs, wrak of gevaar.  

.2 De plaats van het ijs, wrak of gevaar toen dit het laatst werd waargenomen.  

.3 De datum en tijd (UTC, Coordinated Universal Time ) van deze laatste waarneming.    

2 Tropische cyclonen (stormen) 

.1 Een mededeling dat een tropische cycloon ontmoet werd. Deze verplichting moet ruim worden opgevat en informatie moet worden verzonden telkens als de kapitein goede redenen heeft om aan te nemen dat een tropische cycloon zich ontwikkelt of in de nabijheid bestaat;  

.2 Datum, tijd (UTC, Coordinated Universal Time) en bestek van het schip op het moment van de waarneming.  

.3 In het bericht moet, voor zover uitvoerbaar, zoveel mogelijk informatie over het navolgende worden opgenomen: 

 – barometerstand, bij voorkeur gecorrigeerd (met vermelding van millibaren, inches of millimeters en onder opgave of de aflezing al dan niet gecorrigeerd is);  

 – verloop van de luchtdruk (verandering in de barometerstand gedurende de afgelopen drie uren);  

 – ware windrichting;  

 – windkracht (volgens de schaal van Beaufort);  

 – toestand van de zee (vlak, kabbelend tot lichtgolvend, aanschietend, hoog);  

 – deining (laag, matig hoog, hoog) en de ware richting van waar deze komt. Opgave van periode of lengte van de deining (kort, matig lang, lang) kan ook van belang zijn;  

 – ware koers en snelheid van het schip.       
###Latere waarnemingen

3 Wanneer een kapitein een tropische cycloon of andere gevaarlijke storm heeft gerapporteerd, is het gewenst, hoewel niet verplicht, dat zolang het schip onder invloed van de storm blijft, verdere waarnemingen om het uur worden verricht en verzonden en dat, wanneer dit niet mogelijk is, deze waarnemingen in elk geval met tussenpozen van niet langer dan drie uur worden verricht en verzonden.  

4 Stormen met windkracht 10 of hoger volgens de schaal van Beaufort, waarvoor geen stormwaarschuwing werd ontvangen. Hiermee worden andere stormen bedoeld dan de tropische stormen genoemd in paragraaf 2; bij het ontmoeten van een dergelijke storm moet het te verzenden bericht de in paragraaf 2 vermelde informatie bevatten, evenwel met uitzondering van de bijzonderheden betreffende zee en deining.  

5 Luchttemperaturen onder het vriespunt gepaard gaande met stormwinden, die zware ijsafzetting op de bovenbouw veroorzaken: 

.1 Datum en tijd (UTC, Coordinated Universal Time).  

.2 Temperatuur van de lucht.

### Voorschrift  33  

####Noodsituaties: verplichtingen en procedures

1.  De kapitein van een schip op zee dat zich in een positie bevindt die hulpverlening mogelijk maakt, is gehouden, wanneer hij informatie, uit welke bron ook, ontvangt dat mensen op zee in nood verkeren, met de meeste spoed deze mensen te hulp te komen, hen of de opsporings- en reddingsdienst zo mogelijk daaromtrent inlichtende. Deze verplichting tot het bieden van bijstand is van toepassing ongeacht de nationaliteit of status van deze personen of de omstandigheden waaronder zij worden gevonden. Indien het schip dat het noodsignaal ontvangt niet in staat is of het, in de bijzondere omstandigheden van het geval, onredelijk of onnodig acht hen te hulp te komen, moet de kapitein in het logboek vermelden om welke reden hij de in nood verkerende personen niet te hulp is gekomen en, met inachtneming van de aanbeveling van de Organisatie, de betreffende opsporings- en reddingsdienst hiervan op de hoogte brengen.   
1-1.  De Verdragsluitende Regeringen coördineren en werken samen om te waarborgen dat kapiteins van schepen die bijstand verlenen door op zee in nood verkerende personen aan boord te nemen, waarbij verder zo min mogelijk wordt afgeweken van de voorgenomen reis van het schip, van hun verplichtingen worden ontheven, mits het ontheffen van de kapitein van het schip van de verplichtingen uit hoofde van dit voorschrift de veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee niet nader in gevaar brengt. De Verdragsluitende Regering die verantwoordelijk is voor de opsporing en redding in de regio waar deze bijstand wordt geboden, is de hoofdverantwoordelijke voor het in gang zetten van deze coördinatie en samenwerking, zodat de overlevenden aan wie bijstand werd geboden van het bijstand verlenende schip worden ontscheept en naar een veilig onderkomen worden gebracht, met inachtneming van de bijzondere omstandigheden van het geval en van de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtsnoeren. In deze gevallen zorgen de desbetreffende Verdragsluitende Regeringen ervoor dat deze ontscheping zo spoedig plaatsvindt als redelijkerwijze mogelijk is.   
2.  De kapitein van een in nood verkerend schip of de desbetreffende opsporings- en reddingsdienst hebben het recht, na voor zover mogelijk de kapiteins te hebben geraadpleegd van de schepen die zijn oproep om hulp hebben beantwoord, één of meer van deze schepen die hij het beste in staat acht hulp te verlenen daartoe op te vorderen, en het is de plicht van de kapitein van het opgevorderde schip of de kapiteins van de opgevorderde schepen gevolg te geven aan de opvordering door met de meeste spoed het te hulp komen van de in nood verkerende personen voort te zetten.   
3.  Kapiteins van schepen zijn ontheven van de krachtens paragraaf 1 op hen rustende verplichting wanneer zij vernemen dat hun schip niet is opgevorderd en dat één of meer andere schepen zijn opgevorderd en aan de opvordering gevolg geven. Dit besluit moet, indien mogelijk, aan de andere opgevorderde schepen en aan de opsporings- en reddingsdienst worden medegedeeld.   
4.  De kapitein van een schip is ontheven van de krachtens paragraaf 1 op hem rustende verplichting en, indien zijn schip opgevorderd is, van de krachtens paragraaf 2 op hem rustende verplichting, indien hem door de in nood verkerende personen of door de opsporings- en reddingsdienst of door de kapitein van een ander schip dat deze personen heeft bereikt, wordt medegedeeld dat hulpverlening niet langer nodig is.   
5.  De bepalingen van dit voorschrift maken geen inbreuk op het „Verdrag tot het vaststellen van enige eenvormige regelen betreffende hulp en berging op zee”, gesloten te Brussel op 23 september 1910, in het bijzonder wat betreft de verplichting tot hulpverlening, opgenomen in artikel 11 van dat Verdrag.   
6.  De kapiteins van schepen die op zee in nood verkerende personen aan boord hebben genomen, behandelen deze personen, binnen de mogelijkheden en beperkingen van het schip, op menswaardige wijze.   

### Voorschrift  34  

####Veilige navigatie en vermijding van gevaarlijke situaties

1 Voordat zee wordt gekozen moet de kapitein ervoor zorgen dat de voorgenomen reis is gepland met gebruikmaking van de juiste nautische kaarten en nautische publicaties voor het betrokken gebied, met inachtneming van de door de Organisatie opgestelde richtlijnen en aanbevelingen.  

2 Bij de reisplanning moet een zodanige route worden gekozen dat: 

.1 rekening wordt gehouden met eventuele routeringssystemen voor schepen;  

.2 gewaarborgd wordt dat er gedurende de gehele reis voldoende zeeruimte is voor de veilige doorgang van het schip;  

.3 geanticipeerd wordt op bekende navigatiegevaren en slechte weersomstandigheden; en  

.4 rekening wordt gehouden met de vigerende maatregelen voor de bescherming van het mariene milieu, en werkzaamheden en activiteiten die het milieu zouden kunnen aantasten zoveel mogelijk worden voorkomen.      

### Voorschrift  34-1  

####Oordeel van de kapitein

De eigenaar, bevrachter of maatschappij die het schip exploiteert als omschreven in voorschrift IX/1, of iedere andere persoon, mag de kapitein van het schip geen verboden of beperkingen opleggen bij het nemen of uitvoeren van bepaalde besluiten die, naar het professionele oordeel van de kapitein, nodig zijn voor de veiligheid van mensenlevens op zee en de bescherming van het mariene milieu.  

### Voorschrift  35  

####Misbruik van noodseinen

Het gebruik van een internationaal noodsein, behalve om aan te geven dat een of meerdere personen in nood verkeren, en het gebruik van welk sein ook dat met een internationaal noodsein kan worden verward, is verboden.

.6 Bijdragende Regering, een Verdragsluitende Regering die zich ertoe verplicht uit hoofde van deze Regels een bijdrage te leveren aan de kosten van de IJspatrouilledienst.    

2 Elke Verdragsluitende Regering die in het bijzonder bij deze diensten belang heeft en wier schepen gedurende het ijsseizoen door gebieden varen waar ijsbergen kunnen voorkomen, verplicht zich ertoe een bijdrage te betalen aan de Verenigde Staten van Amerika ten belope van haar proportionele aandeel in de kosten voor het beheer en de exploitatie van de IJspatrouilledienst. De bijdrage aan de Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika wordt gebaseerd op de verhouding van het gemiddelde jaarlijkse brutotonnage van de schepen van die bijdragende Regering die de voorgaande drie jaren door het gebied dat door de IJspatrouilledienst wordt bewaakt, zijn gevaren, tot het gecombineerde gemiddelde jaarlijkse brutotonnage van alle schepen die de voorgaande drie jaren door het gebied dat door de IJspatrouilledienst wordt bewaakt, zijn gevaren.  

3 Alle bijdragen worden berekend door het in paragraaf 2 beschreven percentage te vermenigvuldigen met de gemiddelde jaarlijkse kosten die door de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten en Canada gedurende de voorgaande drie jaren zijn gemaakt voor het beheren en exploiteren van de IJspatrouilledienst. Dit percentage wordt jaarlijks berekend en wordt uitgedrukt in een eenmalig contributiebedrag per jaar.  

4 Elke bijdragende Regering heeft het recht haar bijdrage te wijzigen of te beëindigen en andere belanghebbende Regeringen kunnen op zich nemen in de kosten bij te dragen. De bijdragende Regering, die van genoemd recht gebruik maakt, zal evenwel aansprakelijk blijven voor haar lopende bijdrage tot de eerste september volgende op de datum, waarop mededeling wordt gedaan van het voornemen de bijdrage te veranderen of te beëindigen. Om van dit recht profijt te trekken, moet de kennisgeving aan de beherende Regering ten minste zes maanden vóór bedoelde eerste september zijn gedaan.  

5 Elke bijdragende Regering brengt de door haar uit hoofde van paragraaf 2 aangegane verplichting ter kennis van de Secretaris-Generaal, die alle Verdragsluitende Regeringen in kennis stelt.  

6 De Regering van de Verenigde Staten van Amerika doet jaarlijks aan elke bijdragende Regering een overzicht toekomen van de totale kosten die door de Regeringen van de Verenigde Staten en Canada zijn gemaakt voor het beheer en de exploitatie van de IJspatrouilledienst gedurende dat jaar en van het gemiddelde procentuele aandeel van elke bijdragende Regering over de voorgaande drie jaren.  

7 De beherende regeringen publiceren een jaarrekening, met inbegrip van een overzicht van de kosten die gedurende de voorgaande drie jaren door de dienstverlenende regeringen zijn gemaakt en van het totale brutotonnage dat gedurende de voorgaande drie jaren van de diensten gebruik heeft gemaakt. De jaarrekeningen zijn toegankelijk voor het publiek. Binnen drie maanden na de ontvangst van het kostenoverzicht kunnen de bijdragende Regeringen om nadere informatie verzoeken met betrekking tot de kosten van het beheer en de exploitatie van de IJspatrouilledienst.  

8 Deze Regels zijn van toepassing met ingang van het ijsseizoen 2002.

### Voorschrift  7  

####Laden, lossen en stuwen van vaste bulklading

1.  Voor de toepassing van dit voorschrift wordt onder vertegenwoordiger van de laad-/loslocatie verstaan de door de laad-/loslocatie of een andere faciliteit waar het schip laadt of lost aangestelde persoon die verantwoordelijk is voor de handelingen door die haven of faciliteit die verband houden met het desbetreffende schip.   
2.  Om de kapitein in staat te stellen te grote spanningen op de constructie van het schip te voorkomen, moet op het schip een boekje aanwezig zijn dat is opgesteld in een taal die beheerst wordt door de officieren van het schip die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de behandeling van de lading. Indien deze taal niet de Engelse taal is, moet op het schip tevens een boekje aanwezig zijn dat in de Engelse taal is opgesteld. Het boekje moet ten minste bevatten: 

.1 stabiliteitsgegevens als vereist in voorschrift II-1/5-1;  

.2 ballast- en ontballastpercentages en -volumes;  

.3 maximaal toegestane belasting per oppervlakte-eenheid van de bovenbeplating van de tanks;  

.4 maximaal toegestane belasting per ruim;  

.5 algemene instructies voor laden en lossen met betrekking tot de sterkte van de constructie van het schip met inbegrip van beperkingen bij de ongunstigste omstandigheden tijdens laden, lossen, ballasten en de reis;  

.6 eventuele speciale restricties zoals beperkingen bij de ongunstigste omstandigheden als opgelegd door de Administratie of een door haar erkende organisatie, indien van toepassing; en  

.7 waar berekeningen van de sterkte zijn vereist, maximaal toegestane krachten en momenten op de romp van het schip tijdens laden, lossen en de reis.     
3.  Voordat een vaste lading wordt geladen of gelost, moeten de kapitein en de vertegenwoordiger van de laad-/loslocatie een plan overeenkomen dat waarborgt dat de toegestane krachten en momenten op het schip niet worden overschreden tijdens het laden of lossen en dat voorziet in de volgorde, de kwantiteit en het tempo van laden of lossen, rekening houdend met de snelheid van laden of lossen, het aantal stortingen en de ballast en ontballastcapaciteit van het schip. Het plan en eventuele latere wijzigingen daarop moeten worden ingediend bij de desbetreffende autoriteit van de staat waartoe de haven behoort.   
4.  De kapitein en de vertegenwoordiger van de laad-/loslocatie moeten ervoor zorgen dat de laad- en loshandelingen verlopen in overeenstemming met het overeengekomen plan.   
5.  Indien tijdens het laden of lossen één van de beperkingen van het schip bedoeld in paragraaf 2 wordt overschreden of waarschijnlijk zal worden overschreven indien het laden of lossen doorgaat, heeft de kapitein het recht de laad- of loshandeling te onderbreken en is hij verplicht de desbetreffende autoriteit van de staat van de haven waar het plan is ingediend op de hoogte te stellen. De kapitein en de vertegenwoordiger van de laad-/loslocatie moeten erop toezien dat herstellende maatregelen worden genomen. Bij het lossen van ladingen moeten de kapitein en de vertegenwoordiger van de laad-/loslocatie erop toezien dat de wijze van lossen niet leidt tot beschadiging van de constructie van het schip.   
6.  De kapitein moet erop toezien dat de bemanning van het schip de behandeling van de lading voortdurend bewaakt. Indien mogelijk, moet de diepgang van het schip regelmatig worden gecontroleerd tijdens laden of lossen ter bevestiging van de verstrekte inhoudsgegevens. Iedere observatie ten aanzien van diepgang en inhoud moet worden opgenomen in een ladingslogboek. Indien significante afwijkingen van het overeengekomen plan worden ontdekt, moeten de ladings- of de ballasthandelingen of beide worden aangepast om ervoor te zorgen dat de afwijkingen worden gecorrigeerd.

####Toepassing

1 Dit hoofdstuk is van toepassing op: 

.1 de volgende soorten schepen die voor internationale reizen worden gebruikt: 

.1.1 passagiersschepen met inbegrip van hogesnelheidspassagiersvaartuigen;  

.1.2 vrachtschepen, met inbegrip van hogesnelheidsvaartuigen, met een bruto tonnage van 500 of meer; en  

.1.3 booreenheden; en    

.2 havenfaciliteiten die dergelijke voor internationale reizen gebruikte schepen afhandelen.    

2 Onverminderd de bepalingen van paragraaf 1.2, beslissen de Verdragsluitende Regeringen in hoeverre dit hoofdstuk en de relevante hoofdstukken van deel A van de ISPS-Code van toepassing zijn op die havenfaciliteiten op hun grondgebied die niet hoofdzakelijk voor internationale reizen makende schepen worden gebruikt, maar incidenteel schepen die in verband met een internationale reis aankomen of afvaren moeten afhandelen.  

2.1 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen baseren hun besluiten, krachtens paragraaf 2 op beveiligingsbeoordelingen van havenfaciliteiten die worden verricht overeenkomstig het bepaalde in deel A van de ISPS-Code.  

2.2 Geen enkel door een Verdragsluitende Regering krachtens paragraaf 2 genomen besluit mag ten koste gaan van het door dit hoofdstuk of door deel A van de ISPS-Code beoogde beveiligingsniveau.  

3 Dit hoofdstuk is niet van toepassing op oorlogsschepen, marinehulpschepen of andere schepen die het eigendom zijn of geëxploiteerd worden door een Verdragsluitende Regering en uitsluitend voor niet-commerciële overheidsdiensten worden gebruikt.  

4 Niets in dit hoofdstuk mag afbreuk doen aan de uit het internationaal recht voortvloeiende rechten en verplichtingen van staten.    

### Voorschrift  3  

####Verplichtingen van de Verdragsluitende Regeringen met betrekking tot de beveiliging

1 Administraties stellen beveiligingsniveaus vast en zorgen dat de schepen die het recht hebben om onder hun vlag te varen over deze beveiligingsniveaus worden geïnformeerd. In geval van wijzigingen van het beveiligingsniveau wordt de beveiligingsniveau-informatie bijgewerkt zoals de omstandigheden vereisen.  

2 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen stellen beveiligingsniveaus vast en zorgen dat de havenfaciliteiten op hun grondgebied en de schepen, voordat zij een haven binnenlopen of terwijl zij zich in een haven op hun grondgebied bevinden, over deze beveiligingsniveaus worden geïnformeerd. In geval van wijzigingen van het beveiligingsniveau wordt de beveiligingsniveau-informatie bijgewerkt naar gelang de omstandigheden dit vereisen.    

### Voorschrift  4  

####Eisen voor maatschappijen en schepen

1 De maatschappijen leven de relevante eisen van dit hoofdstuk en van deel A van de ISPS-Code na, waarbij ze rekening houden met de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren.  

2 De schepen leven de relevante eisen van dit hoofdstuk en van deel A van de ISPS-Code na, waarbij ze rekening houden met de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren. De naleving wordt gecontroleerd en gecertificeerd overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deel A van de ISPS-Code.  

3 Alvorens een haven binnen te lopen, of terwijl het zich in een haven op het grondgebied van een Verdragsluitende Regering bevindt, voldoet een schip aan de eisen met betrekking tot het door die Verdragsluitende Regering vastgestelde beveiligingsniveau, indien dit beveiligingsniveau hoger is dan het door de Administratie voor dat schip vastgestelde beveiligingsniveau.  

4 Schepen reageren zo spoedig mogelijk op iedere overschakeling op een hoger beveiligingsniveau.  

5 Indien een schip zich niet houdt aan de eisen van dit hoofdstuk of van deel A van de ISPS-Code, dan wel niet kan voldoen aan de eisen met betrekking tot het door de Administratie of door een andere Verdragsluitende Regering vastgestelde en op dat schip van toepassing zijnde beveiligingsniveau, dan meldt het schip dit aan de betreffende bevoegde autoriteit alvorens over te gaan tot enige schip/haven raakvlak of alvorens de haven binnen te lopen, afhankelijk van de situatie die zich het eerst voordoet.    

### Voorschrift  5  

####Specifieke verantwoordelijkheid van de maatschappijen

De maatschappij zorgt ervoor dat de kapitein te allen tijde de informatie aan boord heeft aan de hand waarvan bevoegde ambtenaren van een Verdragsluitende Regering kunnen vaststellen: 

.1 wie verantwoordelijk is voor de aanwijzing van de bemanningsleden of andere personen die op dat moment in welke hoedanigheid dan ook aan boord van een schip in dienst of te werk gesteld zijn ten behoeve van dat schip;  

.2 wie degene is die beslist over de bezigheid van het schip; en  

.3 wanneer het schip gebruikt wordt in het kader van een charterpartij (charterpartijen), wie de partijen zijn bij deze charterpartij(en).    

### Voorschrift  6  

####Scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem

1 Alle schepen worden uitgerust met een scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem, en wel als volgt: 

.1 op of na 1 juli 2004 gebouwde schepen;  

.2 vóór 1 juli 2004 gebouwde passagiersschepen, met inbegrip van hogesnelheidspassagiersvaartuigen, uiterlijk op de datum van het eerste onderzoek van de radio-installatie na 1 juli 2004;  

.3 vóór 1 juli 2004 gebouwde olietankschepen, chemicaliëntankers, gastankers, bulkcarriers en hogesnelheidsvrachtvaartuigen, met een brutotonnage van 500 of meer, uiterlijk op de datum van het eerste onderzoek van de radio-installatie na 1 juli 2004; en  

.4 andere vrachtschepen met een brutotonnage van 500 of meer en booreenheden die vóór 1 juli 2004 gebouwd zijn, uiterlijk op de datum van het eerste onderzoek van de radio-installatie na 1 juli 2006.    

2 Wanneer het scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem wordt ingeschakeld: 

.1 stelt het een schip/wal-beveiligingsalarm in werking en zendt dit naar een door de Administratie aangewezen bevoegde autoriteit, die in deze omstandigheden ook de maatschappij kan zijn, dat de identiteit en positie van het schip vermeldt en aangeeft of de beveiliging van het schip wordt bedreigd of in gevaar is gebracht;  

.2 zendt het dit scheepsbeveiligingsalarm niet naar andere schepen;  

.3 stelt het geen alarm aan boord van het schip in werking; en  

.4 houdt het het scheepsbeveiligingsalarm in werking totdat het wordt uitgeschakeld en/of opnieuw wordt ingesteld.    

3 Het scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem: 

.1 kan vanaf de navigatiebrug en op minstens één andere plaats worden ingeschakeld;  

.2 voldoet aan prestatienormen die niet lager zijn dan de door de Organisatie aangenomen normen.    

4 De inschakelpunten van het scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem zijn zo ontworpen dat het scheepsbeveiligingsalarm niet per ongeluk kan worden ingeschakeld.  

5 Aan de eis van een scheepsbeveiligingsalarmsysteem kan worden voldaan met een radio-installatie die is aangepast aan de eisen van hoofstuk IV, maar dan ook aan alle eisen van dit voorschrift moet voldoen.  

6 Wanneer een Administratie een melding binnenkrijgt van een scheepsbeveiligingsalarm, stelt die Administratie onmiddellijk de staat (staten) in de nabijheid waarvan het schip zich op dat moment bevindt in kennis.  

7 Wanneer een Verdragsluitende Regering een melding ontvangt van een scheepsbeveiligingsalarm van een schip dat niet gerechtigd is onder zijn vlag te varen, stelt die Verdragsluitende Regering onmiddellijk de desbetreffende Administratie in kennis en, indien van toepassing, de staat (staten) in de nabijheid waarvan het schip zich op dat moment bevindt.    

### Voorschrift  7  

####Bedreigingen voor schepen

1 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen stellen beveiligingsniveaus vast, en zorgen ervoor dat in hun territoriale wateren varende schepen, of schepen die hebben medegedeeld dat zij van plan zijn zich in hun territoriale wateren te begeven, over deze beveiligingsniveaus worden geïnformeerd.  

2 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen zorgen voor een aanspreekpunt waar deze schepen om raad of bijstand kunnen vragen, en waar zij eventuele met de beveiliging verband houdende zorgen over andere schepen, scheepsbewegingen of berichten kunnen melden.  

3 Indien is vastgesteld dat er gevaar bestaat voor een aanval, licht de betrokken Verdragsluitende Regering de betrokken schepen en hun Administraties in over: 

.1 het huidige beveiligingsniveau;  

.2 de beveiligingsmaatregelen die de betrokken schepen moeten nemen om zichzelf tegen een aanval te beschermen, overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deel A van de ISPS-code; en  

.3 de beveiligingsmaatregelen die de kuststaat besloten heeft te nemen, naar gelang van toepassing.      

### Voorschrift  8  

####Beslissingsvrijheid van de kapitein met betrekking tot de veiligheid en beveiliging van het schip

1 De kapitein wordt niet door de maatschappij, de verlader of enige andere persoon weerhouden van het nemen of het uitvoeren van een beslissing die naar het professionele oordeel van de kapitein moet worden genomen voor de veiligheid en ter beveiliging van het schip. Dit houdt ook in dat hij personen (behalve personen waarvan vaststaat dat zij naar behoren door een Verdragsluitende Regering zijn gemachtigd) of hun eigendommen de toegang kan ontzeggen en kan weigeren vracht, inclusief containers en andere afgesloten vrachttransporteenheden, aan boord te nemen.  

2 Indien er tijdens de bedrijfsactiviteiten van het schip een situatie ontstaat, waarbij volgens het professioneel oordeel van de kapitein, voor het schip geldende eisen inzake veiligheid en beveiliging met elkaar in strijd zijn, geeft de kapitein uitvoering aan de eisen die noodzakelijk zijn voor de veiligheid van het schip. De kapitein kan in dergelijke gevallen tijdelijke beveiligingsmaatregelen treffen, en hij informeert onverwijld de Administratie en, indien van toepassing, de Verdragsluitende Regering van het land in wier haven het schip zich bevindt of voornemens is binnen te lopen. Al dergelijke tijdelijke beveiligingsmaatregelen in het kader van dit voorschrift dienen in de hoogst mogelijke mate afgestemd te zijn op het geldende beveiligingsniveau. Wanneer dergelijke gevallen worden vastgesteld, zorgt de Administratie ervoor dat deze strijdigheden worden opgelost en dat de kans op herhaling tot een minimum wordt beperkt.    

### Voorschrift  9  

####Controle- en handhavingsmaatregelen

###1 Controle van schepen in de haven

1.1 Volgens dit hoofdstuk kan ieder schip waarop dit hoofdstuk van toepassing is in de haven van een andere Verdragsluitende Regering gecontroleerd worden door bevoegde ambtenaren van die regering, die eveneens de functies van voorschrift I/19 kunnen vervullen. Bij deze controle wordt alleen geverifieerd of het schip beschikt over een geldig internationaal scheepsbeveiligingscertificaat of een geldig voorlopig internationaal scheepsbeveiligingscertificaat dat is afgegeven krachtens het bepaalde in deel A van de ISPS-Code („certificaat”), hetgeen aanvaard wordt indien het geldig is, tenzij er gegronde redenen zijn om aan te nemen dat het schip niet voldoet aan de eisen van dit hoofdstuk of van deel A van de ISPS-Code.  

1.2 Wanneer die gegronde redenen aanwezig zijn, of wanneer er desgevraagd geen geldig certificaat wordt overgelegd, leggen de bevoegde ambtenaren van de Verdragsluitende Regering één of meer controlemaatregelen op met betrekking tot het schip, overeenkomstig het bepaalde in paragraaf 1.3. Al deze opgelegde maatregelen moeten evenredig zijn en er moet rekening worden gehouden met de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren.  

1.3. De volgende controlemaatregelen kunnen worden opgelegd: inspectie van het schip, ophouding van het schip, aanhouding van het schip, beperking van de bedrijfsvoering, met inbegrip van bewegingen binnen de haven, of uitwijzing van het schip uit de haven. Ter aanvulling van deze controlemaatregelen, of in plaats daarvan, kunnen ook andere, minder verregaande administratieve of corrigerende maatregelen worden genomen.   
###2 Schepen die voornemens zijn een haven van een andere Verdragsluitende Regering aan te doen

2.1 In de zin van dit hoofdstuk kan een Verdragsluitende Regering eisen dat schepen die voornemens zijn zijn havens aan te doen onderstaande informatie verschaffen aan bevoegde ambtenaren van die regering, teneinde de naleving van dit hoofdstuk te verzekeren voordat het schip de haven binnenloopt, en zo te vermijden dat er controlemaatregelen moeten worden opgelegd of stappen ondernomen: 

.1 of het schip beschikt over een geldig certificaat, en de naam van de autoriteit die het heeft uitgereikt;  

.2 het beveiligingsniveau waarop het schip momenteel opereert;  

.3 het beveiligingsniveau waarop het schip in een vorige haven heeft geopereerd, toen het een schip/haven raakvlak heeft uitgevoerd binnen het in paragraaf 2.3 aangegeven tijdsbestek;  

.4 eventuele speciale of aanvullende beveiligingsmaatregelen die door het schip zijn genomen in een vorige haven waar het een schip/haven raakvlak heeft uitgevoerd binnen het in paragraaf 2.3 aangegeven tijdsbestek;  

.5 of de passende scheepsbeveiligingsprocedures zijn gevolgd gedurende een schip-tot-schip-activiteit binnen het in paragraaf 2.3 vermelde tijdsbestek; of  

.6 andere praktische met beveiliging verband houdende informatie (maar geen details over het scheepsbeveiligingsplan) rekening houdend met de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren.   Indien de Verdragsluitende Regering dit vraagt, geven het schip of de maatschappij een voor die Verdragsluitende Regering aanvaardbare bevestiging van de hierboven verlangde informatie.  

2.2 Ieder schip waarop dit hoofdstuk van toepassing is en dat van plan is de haven van een andere Verdragsluitende Regering aan te doen, verschaft de in paragraaf 2.1 beschreven informatie, indien de bevoegde ambtenaren van die regering dit vragen. De kapitein kan weigeren die informatie te verschaffen, maar dient wel te beseffen dat hem dan de toegang tot de haven kan worden ontzegd.  

2.3 Het schip houdt voor de laatste tien havenfaciliteiten die het heeft aangedaan de in paragraaf 2.1 bedoelde gegevens bij.  

2.4 Indien de bevoegde ambtenaren van de Verdragsluitende Regering van de haven die het schip voornemens is aan te doen na ontvangst van de in paragraaf 2.1 beschreven informatie gegronde redenen hebben om aan te nemen dat het schip niet aan de eisen van dit hoofdstuk of deel A van de ISPS-Code voldoet, proberen genoemde ambtenaren communicatie tot stand te brengen met het schip en tussen het schip en de Administratie om de niet-naleving recht te zetten. Indien deze communicatie niet leidt tot rechtzetting, of indien de ambtenaren ook anderszins gegronde redenen hebben om aan te nemen dat het schip niet voldoet aan de eisen van dit hoofdstuk of deel A van de ISPS-Code, kunnen deze ambtenaren met betrekking tot dat schip de in paragraaf 2.5 voorziene stappen zetten. Al dergelijke stappen moeten evenredig zijn en worden gezet aan de hand van de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren.  

2.5 Genoemde stappen zijn: 

.1 een eis tot rechtzetting van de niet-naleving;  

.2 een eis dat het schip zich begeeft naar een aangewezen plaats in de territoriale wateren of de binnenlandse wateren van die Verdragsluitende Regering;  

.3 inspectie van het schip, indien het schip zich in de territoriale wateren bevindt van de Verdragsluitende Regering wier haven het schip voornemens aan te doen; of  

.4 ontzegging van de toegang tot de haven. Alvorens tot dergelijke stappen over te gaan, stelt de Verdragsluitende Regering het schip op de hoogte van haar voornemens. De kapitein kan daarop afzien van zijn voornemen om die haven aan te doen. Dit voorschrift is dan niet van toepassing.     
###3 Aanvullende bepalingen

3.1 Indien: 

.1 een andere controlemaatregel wordt opgelegd dan een in paragraaf 1.3 bedoelde minder verregaande administratieve of corrigerende maatregel; of  

.2 één van de in paragraaf 2.5 bedoelde stappen wordt ondernomen, stelt een bevoegde ambtenaar van de Verdragsluitende Regering de Administratie onverwijld schriftelijk op de hoogte van de opgelegde controlemaatregelen of ondernomen stappen, alsmede van de redenen daarvoor. De Verdragsluitende Regering die de controlemaatregelen oplegt of de stappen onderneemt meldt ook aan het erkend beveiligingsbedrijf dat het certificaat voor het betreffende schip heeft afgegeven, en aan de Organisatie wanneer deze controlemaatregelen zijn opgelegd of deze stappen zijn ondernomen.    

3.2 Wanneer een schip de toegang tot de haven wordt ontzegd of wordt uitgewezen, dienen de havenstaatautoriteiten de bewuste feiten mede te delen aan de havenstaatautoriteiten van de volgende in aanmerking komende aanloophavens, indien deze bekend zijn, en eventuele andere in aanmerking komende kuststaten, rekening houdende met door de Organisatie te ontwikkelen richtsnoeren. De geheimhouding en beveiliging van deze meldingen worden gegarandeerd.  

3.3 Het ontzeggen van de toegang tot de haven overeenkomstig de paragrafen 2.4 en 2.5 of uitwijzing overeenkomstig de paragrafen 1.1 tot en met 1.3 zijn maatregelen die alleen worden opgelegd wanneer de bevoegde ambtenaren van de Verdragsluitende Regering gegronde redenen hebben om aan te nemen dat het schip een onmiddellijke bedreiging vormt voor beveiliging of veiligheid van personen, of van schepen of andere goederen, en er geen andere passende middelen zijn om die dreiging weg te nemen.  

3.4 De oplegging van de in paragraaf 1.3 bedoelde controlemaatregelen en het nemen van de in paragraaf 2.5 bedoelde stappen vinden overeenkomstig dit voorschrift niet langer plaats wanneer de niet-naleving die aanleiding gaf tot controlemaatregelen of stappen naar tevredenheid van de Verdragsluitende Regering is rechtgezet, rekening houdende met eventuele door het schip of de Administratie voorgestelde acties.  

3.5 Wanneer Verdragsluitende Regeringen controle uitoefenen krachtens paragraaf 1 of stappen ondernemen krachtens paragraaf 2: 

.1 wordt al het mogelijke gedaan om te vermijden dat een schip ten onrechte wordt aangehouden of opgehouden. Indien een schip daardoor ten onrechte wordt aangehouden of opgehouden, heeft het recht op schadevergoeding voor eventuele geleden verliezen of schade; en  

.2 wanneer toegang tot het schip in noodgevallen en om humanitaire of beveiligingsredenen noodzakelijk is, mag deze niet worden belet.      

### Voorschrift  10  

####Eisen met betrekking tot havenfaciliteiten

1. Havenfaciliteiten voldoen aan de desbetreffende eisen van dit hoofdstuk en deel A van de ISPS-Code, rekening houdende met de in deel B van de ISPS-Code gegeven richtsnoeren.  

2. Verdragsluitende Regeringen met op hun grondgebied een havenfaciliteit of havenfaciliteiten waarop dit voorschrift van toepassing is, zorgen ervoor dat:  

.1 de beveiligingsbeoordelingen van de havenfaciliteiten overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deel A van de ISPS-Code worden uitgevoerd, herzien en goedgekeurd; en  

.2 de beveiligingsplannen van de havenfaciliteiten overeenkomstig de bepalingen van deel A van de ISPS-Code worden ontwikkeld, herzien, goedgekeurd en ten uitvoer gelegd.  

3. De Verdragsluitende Regeringen moeten duidelijk aangeven en mededelen welke maatregelen in een beveiligingsplan van een havenfaciliteit voor de verschillende beveiligingsniveaus moeten worden opgenomen, waaronder wanneer een beveiligingsverklaring moet worden overgelegd.    

### Voorschrift  11  

####Alternatieve beveiligingsovereenkomsten

1 De Verdragsluitende Regeringen mogen, bij de implementatie van dit hoofdstuk en deel A van de ISPS-Code schriftelijk bilaterale of multilaterale overeenkomsten met andere Verdragsluitende Regeringen sluiten voor alternatieve beveiligingsregelingen met betrekking tot korte internationale reizen op vaste routes tussen op hun grondgebieden gelegen havenfaciliteiten.  

2 Deze overeenkomsten gaan niet ten koste van het beveiligingsniveau van andere niet onder de overeenkomst vallende schepen of havenfaciliteiten.  

3 Onder dergelijke overeenkomsten vallende schepen verrichten geen schip-tot-schip-activiteiten met niet onder de overeenkomst vallende schepen.  

4 Deze overeenkomsten worden periodiek herzien, rekening houdend met de opgedane ervaring en eventuele wijzigingen van de specifieke omstandigheden of de beoordeelde bedreigingen voor de beveiliging van de onder de overeenkomst vallende schepen, havenfaciliteiten of routes.    

### Voorschrift  12  

####Gelijkwaardige beveiligingsregelingen

1 Een Administratie kan toestaan dat een bepaald schip, of een groep schepen, dat/die gerechtigd is onder haar vlag te varen andere met de in dit hoofdstuk of in deel A van de ISPS-Code voorgeschreven maatregelen gelijkstaande maatregelen uitvoert, mits deze beveiligingsmaatregelen minstens even doeltreffend zijn als de in dit hoofdstuk of deel A van de ISPS-Code voorgeschreven maatregelen. Een Administratie die dergelijke beveiligingsmaatregelen toestaat, deelt de bijzonderheden daaromtrent mede aan de Organisatie.  

2 Bij de implementatie van dit hoofdstuk en deel A van de ISPS-Code kan een Verdragsluitende Regering een bepaalde op haar grondgebied gelegen havenfaciliteit, of groep havenfaciliteiten, die niet valt onder een krachtens voorschrift 11 gesloten overeenkomst toestaan beveiligingsmaatregelen te implementeren, mits deze beveiligingsmaatregelen minstens even doeltreffend zijn als de in dit hoofdstuk of deel A van de ISPS-Code voorgeschreven maatregelen. Een Verdragsluitende Regering die dergelijke beveiligingsmaatregelen toestaat deelt de bijzonderheden daaromtrent aan de Organisatie mede.    

### Voorschrift  13
