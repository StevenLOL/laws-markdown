2. In the remainder of the present Article, the term “assignment in accordance with the Agreement” means any frequency assignment appearing in the Plan or for which the procedure of this Article has been successfully applied.
3. *Proposed Changes in the Characteristics of an Assignment or the Bringing into Use of a new Assignment*

3.1Any administration proposing a change in the characteristics of an assignment or the bringing into use of a new assignment shall seek the agreement of all the administrations having an assignment in accordance with the Agreement, in the same channel or an adjacent channel, which is considered to be affected (see 3.2.5 and 3.3.1).

3.2*Channels other than Low-Power Channels*

3.2.1An administration proposing to change the characteristics of an assignment or to bring a new assignment into use shall so inform the I.F.R.B. and furnish the characteristics of the modification or addition in the form adopted in the Plan and its appendices.

3.2.1.1Where the proposed modification is within the limits defined in 3.2.9, the information shall contain a reference to that paragraph.

3.2.1.2In all other cases, in order to arrive at the agreement referred to in 3.1, the administration shall notify to the I.F.R.B. the names of the administrations whose agreement it considers should be sought and of those with which agreement has been reached.

3.2.2The I.F.R.B. shall determine on the basis of Annex 2 to the Agreement the administrations having frequency assignments in accordance with the Agreement which are considered to be affected within the meaning of 3.2.5. The results of these calculations shall be sent immediately by the I.F.R.B. to the administration proposing the modification to the Plan. The I.F.R.B. shall include the names of these administrations in the information received and shall publish the complete information in a special section of its weekly circular.

1.by virtue of No. 185 of the Radio Regulations, Austria may keep the broadcasting station Innsbruck in the band 515-525 kHz provided that it does not cause harmful interference to the maritime mobile service;

2.for many years a synchronized network of three transmitters each of 10 kW carrier power and four transmitters of very low power have been recorded in the Master International Frequency Register on behalf of Austria on the express condition, as specified in No. 115 of the Radio Regulations, that no harmful interference is caused to services carried out by stations operating in accordance with the provisions of the Convention; the use of these transmitters on the frequency 520 kHz with a bandwidth greater than 9 kHz has not given rise to complaint;

3.Austria proposes to change the carrier frequency of the assignment in this band to the nearest multiple of 9 kHz (522 kHz) for the sake of compatibility with the channelling plan adopted by this Conference, to reduce the radiation bandwidth to 9 kHz and to increase the power of the Innsbruck station from 10 to 30 kW.

5.the provisions of this Additional Protocol in no way affect the status of the stations concerned with respect to stations of the other radiocommunication services to which the frequency band 515-525 kHz is allocated and the provisions of Nos. 185 and 115 of the Radio Regulations still apply;

6.the provisions of this Additional Protocol in no way prejudge any decisions which the World Administrative Radio Conference scheduled for 1979 may make concerning No. 185 of the Radio Regulations.
