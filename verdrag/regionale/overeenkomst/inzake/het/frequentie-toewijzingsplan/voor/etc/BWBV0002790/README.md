###Article 4

### *Procedure for Modifications to the Plan* 

###SECTION A - GENERAL

4.1 When a Contracting Member proposes to make a modification to the Plan, that is: a) to modify the characteristics of a frequency assignment to a radiobeacon station of the maritime radionavigation service shown in the Plan, whether or not the station has been brought into use; or b) to bring into use an assignment to a radiobeacon station of the maritime radionavigation service not appearing in the Plan; or c) to modify the characteristics of a frequency assignment to a radiobeacon station of the maritime radionavigation service for which the procedure in this Article has been successfully applied, whether or not the station has been brought into use; or d) to cancel a frequency assignment to a radiobeacon station of the maritime radionavigation service; the following procedure shall be applied at the same time as the notification is made under the provisions of Article 12 of the Radio Regulations (see Article 5 of this Agreement). 
###SECTION B - PROCEDURE FOR MODIFYING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ASSIGNMENT OR THE BRINGING INTO USE OF A NEW ASSIGNMENT

4.2 An administration proposing to modify the characteristics of an assignment or to bring a new assignment into use shall, either directly or through the IFRB, seek the agreement of all other administrations whose assignments may be affected. 4.3 For the purposes of this procedure, these other administrations shall be the administrations of Contracting Members which have: a) assignments in conformity with this Agreement whose service may be affected according to the criteria specified in Appendix 1 to Annex 3; b) assignments recorded in the Master International Frequency Register for stations of the aeronautical radionavigation service which may be affected according to the provisions of No. 1241 of the Radio Regulations together with the technical criteria contained in Appendix 1 to Annex 3. 4.4 An administration proposing to modify the characteristics of an assignment or to bring a new assignment into use may at any time seek the agreement of any other Contracting Member which it has identified following the application of Appendix 1 to Annex 3 as having an assignment in the Plan which may be affected by the proposed modification to the Plan. It shall, in any case, so inform the Board not earlier than 90 days before the date of bringing into use and shall provide the Board with the characteristics listed in Appendix 1 to the Radio Regulations, and the names of the administrations with which it considers agreement should be sought and of those with which agreement has been reached. The IFRB shall consider this information as a notification in accordance with Article 12 of the Radio Regulations. Publication in Part I of the weekly circular shall at the same time constitute information to the Contracting Members on the proposed modification. 4.5 When the Board reaches an unfavourable finding under No. 1241 of the Radio Regulations in relation to frequency assignments recorded in the Master Register on behalf of non-Contracting Members, it shall notify the administration proposing the modification and shall make recommendations with a view to reaching a satisfactory solution to the problem. 4.6 When the Board reaches a favourable finding under No. 1241 of the Radio Regulations in relation to frequency assignments recorded in the Master Register on behalf of non-Contracting Members, it shall examine the modification proposed in relation to assignments: - in conformity with this Agreement; - published in Part I of the weekly circular in accordance with paragraph 4.4 above; - of the aeronautical radionavigation service recorded in the Master Register on behalf of Contracting Members. The Board shall inform the administration proposing the modification of the results of its examination. 4.7 When the administration proposing the modification is informed of the results of the Board's examination, it shall endeavour to seek the agreement of the other administrations as soon as possible and in any case, before bringing the assignment into use, it shall inform the Board of the results of its efforts. 4.8 Following the examination carried out in accordance with paragraph 4.6 above, the Board shall record the assignment in the Master Register in accordance with Nos. 1311 to 1313 of the Radio Regulations indicating the names of those administrations whose agreement has to be obtained. 4.9 When an administration confirms that its assignment has been brought into use, it shall inform the Board of the names of administrations with which agreement has been reached. When the Board finds that the agreement of an administration has not been obtained, it shall request the notifying administration to delete its entry from the Master Register. If this administration insists, its assignment shall be retained in the Master Register subject to the application of the procedure of No. 1255 of the Radio Regulations; the period of two months specified in No. 1259 of the Radio Regulations shall start when the assignment of the Member country whose agreement is required is brought into use. 4.10 When the Board finds that the agreement of Contracting Members is not required or when the Board is informed that the required agreement has been obtained, it shall update the master copy of the Plan. 
###SECTION C - CANCELLATION OF ASSIGNMENTS

4.11 An administration proposing to cancel an assignment in the Plan, whether or not as a result of a modification (for instance a change of frequency), shall immediately so inform the IFRB. The Board shall update the master copy of the Plan accordingly. 
###SECTION D - MAINTENANCE AND PUBLICATION OF THE PLAN

4.12 The IFRB shall maintain an up-to-date master copy of the Plan and its appendices, taking account of the application of the procedure specified in this Article; to this end the IFRB shall periodically prepare recapitulative documents listing all amendments made to the Plan as a result of modifications made in accordance with the procedure of this Article, the addition of new assignments in conformity with this Agreement, and any cancellations of which the Board has been notified. 4.13 The Secretary-General shall publish an up-to-date version of the Plan in an appropriate form as and when circumstances justify and in any case every five years. 
###Article 5

### *Notification of Frequency Assignments* 

5.1 Whenever an administration intends to bring into use an assignment in conformity with this Agreement, it shall notify the assignment to the IFRB in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Radio Regulations. 5.2. Notices of frequency assignments in conformity with this Agreement shall not be examined by the Board under No. 1241 with respect to frequency assignments recorded in the Master Register on behalf of Contracting Members for stations of primary or permitted services of administrations, Parties to this Agreement. 5.3 In relations between Contracting Members, assignments thus brought into service and entered into the Master Register will have the same status, irrespective of the date on which they are brought into service. 
###Article 6

### *Procedure Applicable to New Assignments of the Aeronautical Radionavigation Service* 

6.1 In order to permit the compatible development of the aeronautical radionavigation service in the band 283.5-315 kHz, the IFRB shall examine in accordance with No. 1245 of the Radio Regulations the frequency assignments of this service notified by Contracting Members. To this effect the following provisions shall be applied. 6.2 The Board shall examine the frequency assignment with respect to the probability of harmful interference to the service provided or to be provided by a station for which a frequency assignment: a) is already recorded in the Master Register and bears a date in Column 2a; or b) is in conformity with No. 1240 of the Radio Regulations and is recorded in the Master Register with a date in Column 2b, but has not, in fact, caused harmful interference to any frequency assignment with a date in Column 2a or to any assignment in conformity with No. 1240 with an earlier date in Column 2b; c) is in conformity with this agreement but has not yet been notified in accordance with Article 4; d) was published in Part I of the weekly circular in accordance with paragraph 4.4 (Article 4). 6.3 In the event of the finding being unfavourable with respect to a frequency assignment described in paragraphs 6.2c) or 6.2d) above, if the administration resubmits the notice under No. 1255 of the Radio Regulations the period of two months specified in No. 1259 shall not start until the assignment which gave rise to the unfavourable finding is brought into service. 6.4 For the purpose of these examinations, the IFRB's Technical Standards shall apply.
