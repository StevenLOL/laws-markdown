###SECTION B - PROCEDURE FOR THE MARITIME MOBILE SERVICE

### *Procedure for modifying the characteristics of an assignment or for bringing into use a new assignment* 

4.2 The provisions of this section apply equally to transmitting and receiving coast stations. The agreement referred to in this section shall apply to pairs of frequencies as indicated in Annex 3. 4.3 An administration proposing to modify the characteristics of an assignment or to bring an additional assignment into use shall, either directly or through the IFRB, seek the agreement of all other administrations whose assignments may be affected. 4.4 For the purposes of this procedure, these other administrations shall be any which have: a) assignments in the Plans for the same frequency band and whose service may be affected according to the criteria specified in Annex 5 to this Agreement; b) assignments recorded in the Master Register for stations of services to which the bands 1 606.5-1 625 kHz, 1 635-1 800 kHz and 2 045-2 160 kHz are allocated on a primary or permitted basis which may be affected according to the provisions of No. 1241 of the Radio Regulations together with the technical criteria contained in Annex 6 to this Agreement. 4.5 An administration proposing to modify the characteristics of an assignment or to bring an additional assignment into use shall so inform the IFRB and shall furnish to the IFRB the characteristics listed in Appendix 1 to the Radio Regulations and the names of the administrations with which it considers agreement should be sought and with which agreement has been reached. 4.6 The IFRB shall examine the information received from the standpoint of its conformity with the channelling arrangement contained in Annex 3 to this Agreement. Proposed modifications which are not in conformity with the appropriate channelling arrangement shall be returned to the administration concerned. 4.7 The IFRB shall examine the information received in order to identify the administrations having frequency assignments which may be affected as indicated in paragraph 4.4 above. The results of this examination shall be sent immediately by the IFRB to the administration proposing the modification or addition to the Plan in question. The IFRB shall include the names of those administrations in the information received and shall publish the complete information in a special section of its weekly circular. The Board, shall at the same time, inform those administrations having assignment which it considers, in accordance with paragraph 4.4, may be affected. 4.8 An administration which considers that it should have been included in the list of administrations whose frequency assignments may be affected shall inform the administration proposing the modification or addition to the Plan in question and the IFRB. At the same time it shall, giving its reasons for so doing, request the IFRB to include its name in the list. 4.9 If an administration has not communicated its agreement or disagreement to the proposing administration and to the IFRB within a period of 90 days following the date of the weekly circular referred to in paragraph 4.7, the IFRB shall send a reminder to the administration concerned inviting it to reply urgently to the request for agreement within 15 days from the date of the reminder. If, at the expiry of the two periods of 90 days and 15 days respectively, the administration concerned has still not communicated its agreement or disagreement, it shall be understood to have agreed to the proposed modification or addition. 4.10 If, in seeking agreement, an administration modifies its initial proposal in such a way as to increase the probability of interference to the assignment of an administration with which agreement has been sought, or to affect the assignment of an administration not previously involved, it shall again apply the provisions of paragraph 4.4 and the subsequent procedure for those administrations. 4.11 Following the expiry of the period specified in paragraph 4.9, or when agreement has been reached with the administrations concerned, the administration proposing the modification or addition shall inform the IFRB of the results, indicting the agreed characteristics of the assignment together with the names of the administrations with which agreement has been reached. 4.12 If no agreement is reached between the administrations concerned, the IFRB shall make any study of the matter that may be requested by one or more of those administrations; the Board shall inform them of the results of the study and shall make such recommendations as it may be able to offer for the solution of the problem. 4.13 Before initiating this procedure and at any stage therof, an administration may request the assistance of the IFRB, particularly in seeking the agreement of another administration. 4.14 If, after application of the procedure described in this section agreement has been reached with all administration involved, the Board shall publish an appropriate modification to the Plan (see also paragraph 4.33). 4.15 If, after application of the procedure described in this section, the agreement of the administration concerned cannot be reached, the two administrations may resort to one of the methods for the settlement of disputes described in Article 50 of the Convention or they may agree to apply the Optional Additional Protocol to the Convention. 4.16 The proposed assignment may, despite continuing disagreement, be notified in accordance with Article 12 of the Radio Regulations. However, the relevant provisions of Article 5 of the Agreement shall then be applied.
