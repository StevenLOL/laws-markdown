##Memorandum van overeenstemming tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Verenigde Staten van Amerika over samenwerking inzake defensiematerieel

*Preamble*  The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United States of America, duly represented by their Ministers of Defense: Intending to increase their respective defense capabilities through more efficient cooperation in the fields of research and development, production and procurement in order to: 

- Make the most cost-effective and rational use of the resources available for defense,  

- Ensure the widest possible use of standard or interoperable equipment,  

- Develop and maintain an advanced industrial and technological capability for the North Atlantic Alliance, and particularly with respect to the parties to this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), and   Seeking to improve the present situation and to strengthen their military capability and economic position through the further acquisition of standard or interoperable equipment, and Recalling that they had agreed, as members of the Alliance, to maximum cooperation in procurement as set forth in Annex A to NATO Document C-M(73)51 (revised), dated 20 August 1973, Have entered into this Memorandum of Understanding in order to achieve the above aims. This Memorandum of Understanding sets out the guiding principles governing mutual cooperation in research and development, production and procurement of conventional defense equipment. The two Governments conclude this MOU to strengthen the North Atlantic Alliance. In so doing, the Governments are fully aware that the Independent European Program Group (IEPG) wants to enhance equipment collaboration by more comprehensive and systematic arrangements. They therefore agree that in the event of a possible conflict between agreements entered into between the IEPG and the Government of the United States, and this MOU, the parties hereto will consult with a view to amending this MOU. The two Governments further agree that this MOU should be viewed in the larger context of the cooperation between Europe and North America within the Alliance and that this cooperation will be carried out pursuant to the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, signed 27 January 1950.    

### Article  I  

####Principles Governing Reciprocal Defense Cooperation

1.  Both Governments intend to facilitate the mutual flow of defense procurement, taking into consideration relative technological levels of such procurement, and consistent with their national policies. This facilitation shall be sought through the provision of opportunities to compete for procurements of defense equipment and services as well as through the coproduction of defense equipment and defense R&D cooperation.   
2.  This MOU is intended to cover areas in which possible bilateral cooperation could be achieved in research and development, production and procurement of conventional defense equipment, complementing the work of the Conference of National Armament Directors (CNAD) and the Independent European Program Group (IEPG).   
3.  The two Governments will, consistent with their relevant laws and regulations, give the fullest consideration to all requests for cooperative R&D, and to all requests for production and procurement which are intended to enhance standardization and/or interoperability within the Alliance.   
4.  In the interests of standardization and the effective utilization of scarce resources, the two Governments shall, to the extent possible, adopt qualified defense items that have been developed or produced in the other country to meet their requirements. Defense items or services are those items or services which may be procured utilizing appropriated funds of the U.S. Department of Defense or budgeted funds of the Netherlands Ministry of Defense.   
5.  The two Governments shall mutually determine the counting procedures to be laid down in an Annex to this MOU that will apply to all defense items and defense services purchased by them directly or through their relevant industries under this MOU.   
6.  Each Government shall from time to time notify the other Government of defense items that may not be acquired by the notifying Government from other than domestic sources, as well as those defense items that may be particularly suitable for acquisition by the other Government.   
7.  Both Governments will provide appropriate policy guidance and administrative procedures within their respective defense acquisition organizations to facilitate achievement of the aims of this MOU.   
8.  Competitive contracting procedures shall normally be used in acquiring items of defense equipment developed or produced in each other's country for use by either country's defense establishment.   
9.  The detailed implementing procedures, to be agreed, will, consistent with and to the extent permitted by national laws and regulations, incorporate the following: 

a. Offers or proposals will be evaluated without applying price differentials under buy national laws and regulations and without applying the costs of import duties;  

b. Full consideration will be given to all qualified industrial and/ or governmental resources in each other's country;  

c. Offers or proposals will be required to satisfy requirements of the purchasing Government for performance, quality, delivery and costs.     
10.  Both Governments will review items submitted as candidates for respective requirements. They will indicate requirements and proposed purchases in a timely fashion to ensure adequate time for their respective industries to qualify for eligibility and submit a bid or proposal.   
11.  Each Government will ensure that the technical data packages (TDP's) made available under this MOU are not used for any purpose other than for the purpose of bidding on, and performing, a prospective defense contract without the prior agreement of those owning or controlling proprietary rights and that full protection shall be given to such proprietary rights, or to any privileged, protected, or classified data and information they contain. In no event shall the TDP's be transferred to any third country or any other transferee without the prior written consent of the originating Government.   
12.  Both Governments will use their best efforts to assist in negotiating licenses, royalties and technical information exchanges with their respective industries or other owners of such rights.   
13.  Arrangements and procedures will, at the request of the purchasing government, be established concerning follow-on logistic support for items of defense equipment, purchased pursuant to this MOU. Both Governments will make their defense logistic systems and resources available for this purpose as required and mutually agreed.

### Annex  I  

####to Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United States of America Concerning the Principles Governing Mutual Cooperation in the Research and Development, Production and Procurement of Defense Equipment, dated 24 August 1978

PRINCIPLES GOVERNING IMPLEMENTATION  

1.  *Introduction*  On 24 August 1978, the Governments of the United States and the Kingdom of the Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) relating to the principles governing mutual cooperation in research and development, production and procurement of defense equipment. This document sets forth the agreed implementing procedures for carrying out the MoU.  

2.  *Major Principles*  

A. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands (MoD) will consider for their defense requirements qualified defense items and services developed or produced in the other country.  

B. It will be the responsibility of government and/or industry representatives in each country to acquire information concerning the other country's proposed research, developments, and purchases and to respond to requests for proposals in accordance with the prescribed procurement procedures and regulations. However, the responsible government agencies in each country will assist sources in the other country to obtain information concerning intended research and development, proposed purchases, necessary qualifications and appropriate documentation.    

3.  *Action*  DoD and MoD will review and, where considered necessary, revise policies, procedures and regulations to ensure that the principles and objectives of this MoU, which are intended to be compatible with the broad aims of NATO Rationalization/Standardization, are taken into account. DoD and MoD agree that the following measures shall be taken, recognizing that among other factors, delivery date requirements for supplies, the interest of security and the timely conduct of the procurement process, are considerations related to insure free and full competition for the award of contracts: 

A. Ensure that their respective requirements offices are familiar with the principles and objectives of this MoU.  

B. Ensure that their respective research and development offices and institutes are familiar with the principles and objectives of this MoU.  

C. Ensure that their respective procurement offices are familiar with the principles and objectives of this MoU.  

D. Ensure wide dissemination of the basic understanding of this MoU to their respective industries producing and/or developing defense items and/or services.  

E. Ensure that, consistent with national laws and regulations, offers of defense items produced in the other country will be evaluated without applying to such offers, either price differentials under buy-national laws and regulations, or the cost of import duties. Full consideration will be given to all qualified industrial and/or governmental sources in each other's country. Provisions will be made for duty-free entry certificates and related documentation to the extent that existing laws and regulations permit.  

F. Assist industries in their respective countries to identify and advise the other government of their production capabilities and assist such industries in carrying out the supporting actions to maximize industrial participation.  

G. Review defense items and requests for services submitted by the other country as candidates for respective requirements. Identify requirements and proposed purchases to the other country in a timely fashion to ensure that the industries of such country are afforded adequate time to be able to participate in the research and development production and procurement processes.  

H. Use best efforts to assist in negotiating licences, royalties, and technical information exchanges among their respective industries, and research and development institutes.  

I. Ensure that those items and services excluded from consideration under this MoU for reasons of protecting national requirements, such as the maintenance of a defense mobilization base, (Appendix 3, Annex I), are limited to a small percentage of total annual defense procurement spending. It is intended that such defense items and services, as well as those items and services that must be excluded from consideration under this MoU because of legally imposed restrictions on procurement from non-national sources, be identified as soon as possible by the MoD and the DoD, and that such defense items and services be kept under review at this level.  

J. Insure that the balance of reciprocal purchases takes into consideration the levels of technology involved, as well as the monetary value of purchases hereunder.  

K. DoD and MoD will from time to time arrange visits in order to actively explore possibilities for cooperation on research and development, procurement, and logistical support.    

4.  *Counting Procedures*  The following purchases, to be identified jointly by DoD and MoD will be included in the counting procedures: 

A. Purchases of items and services funded from appropriate funds of the U.S. Department of Defense or budgeted funds of the Netherlands Ministry of Defense and which, either/are: 

(1) directly purchased by the MoD or DoD from one another; or  

(2) directly purchased by the MoD or DoD from the industry of the other country; or  

(3) purchased by the industry of one country from the Government or industry of the other country; or  

(4) purchased as a result of jointly funded defense projects to which the United States and the Netherlands are the only contributors, to be credited in proportion to each other country's financial contribution to the project, and to work carried out in each country. The extent to which such purchases will be counted against the goals of the MoU will be agreed upon between MoD en DoD in each case;  

(5) licence fees, royalties and other associated income, when separately contracted, by industry and/or DoD or MoD with a licensor in the other country.    

B. Purchases by the MoD or DoD from the industry of the other country, on behalf of other governmental departments and agencies.  

C. Purchases by a third country government from the MoD or DoD or from industries of these two countries as direct result of the efforts of the government of the other country.    

5.  *Administration*  

A. Each government will designate points of contact (procurement and logistics) at the Ministry of Defense level and in each purchasing service/agency and major acquisition activity.  

B. Quality Assurance procedures outlined in STANAG 4107 and 4108 (subject to the USG reserve concerning reimbursement) will apply, unless other provisions are mutually agreed to on any specific contract. Reimbursement of services provided shall be afforded in accordance with the national laws and regulations of each country.  

C. The terms of reference of the Netherlands/United States Committee of Procurement Cooperation are contained in Annex III.

###Protection of information

The Security Procedures For Industrial Operations Between the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands and the Department of Defense of the United States of America, developed to implement the provisions of the U.S./Netherlands General Security of Information Agreement, dated April 6, 1981, apply to the safeguarding of classified military information exchanged under this Memorandum of Understanding. Such procedures are applicable in those cases in which contracts, subcontracts, precontract negotiations, or other government approved arrangements, involving classified military information of either or both governments, are placed or entered into by or on behalf of one government with industry in the country of the other government.  *For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands*  (sd.)

###SECURITY PROCEDURES FOR INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS BETWEEN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OF THE NETHERLANDS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES (SECURITY PROTOCOL)

<sup>  These industrial operations may follow for example from the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding concerning the Principles Governing Mutual Cooperation in the Research and Development, Production and Procurement of Defense Equipment.  </sup> 

1. Purpose 

A. The following procedures have been developed to implement the provisions of the General Security of Information Agreement between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Netherlands, entered into on August 18th, 1960, as amended April 6th, 1981. The agreement provides for the safeguarding of all classified information exchanged between the Governments. These procedures will apply to those cases in which contracts, subcontracts, precontract negotiations or other government approved arrangements involving classified information of either or both countries, hereinafter referred to as classified contracts, are placed or entered into by or on behalf of the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands in the United States (U.S.) or by or on behalf of the Department of Defense of the United States in the Netherlands.  

B. These procedures will not apply in the case of contracts that will involve access to cryptographic information, or to other information that would not be releasable under applicable national disclosure policies. Firms which are under the ownership, control or influence (FOCI) of a third party country are not eligible to be awarded classified contracts. Requests for exception to this requirement may be considered on a case-by-case basis by the releasing government. Such requests should identify the source, the amount and other pertinent particulars of the foreign ownership, control or influence. <sup>  FOCI (foreign ownership, control or influence) is defined in DoD Industrial Security Regulation No. 5220.22-R.  </sup>  

C. For the purpose of these procedures classified information is that official information which has been determined to require, in the interests of National Security of the owning or releasing government, protection against unauthorized disclosure and which has so been designated by appropriate security authority. This embraces classified information in any form, be it oral, visual or in the form of material. Material may be any document, product or substance on, or in which, information may be recorded or embodied. Material shall encompass everything regardless of its physical character or makeup including documents, writing, hardware, equipment, machinery, apparatus, devices, models, photographs, recordings, reproductions, notes, sketches, plans, prototypes, designs, configurations, maps and letters, as well as all other products, substances or materials from which information can be derived.    

2. General Upon receipt of classified information furnished under these procedures the receiving government shall undertake to afford the information with substantially the same degree of security protection as afforded it by the releasing government. The receiving government shall be responsible for information so received while it is within its territorial jurisdiction and while it possessed by or furnished to persons authorized to visit abroad pursuant to these procedures. The United States Defense Investigative Service (DIS) and the cognizant military intelligence service in the Netherlands will assume responsibility for administering security measures for a classified contract awarded to industry for performance in their respective countries under the same standards and requirements as govern the protection of their own classified contracts. <sup>  Whenever “government” is used in these procedures the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands or the Department of Defense of the United States is meant unless otherwise specifically indicated.  </sup> 

a) Inspection. The designated government agency shall insure that necessary industrial security inspections are made of each contractor facility engaged in the performance of, or in negotiations for, a classified contract. <sup>  The term “facility” as used in these procedures refers to a corporation or firm which has entered or intends to enter into a contract requiring access to classified information.  </sup>  

b) Security Costs. Costs incurred in conducting security investigations or inspections shall be borne by the government rendering the service. Costs incurred by either of the two Governments through implementation of other security measures, including costs incurred through the use of the diplomatic courier service or any other authorized official courier service, will not be reimbursed. There shall be provisions in classified contracts for security costs to be incurred under the contract, such as special costs for packing, transport and the like, which shall be borne by the party for whom the service is required under the contract. If, subsequent to the date of contract, the security classification or security requirements under the contract are changed, and the security costs or time required for delivery under the contract are thereby increased or decreased, the contract price, delivery schedule, or both and any other provisions of the contract that may be affected shall be subject to an equitable adjustment by reason of such increased or decreased costs. Such equitable adjustments shall be accomplished under the appropriate provisions in the contract governing changes.  

c) Security Clearances. Clearances of contractor facilities and individuals which will possess or be authorized access to classified information shall be processed according to the pertinent regulations of the country having responsibility for administering security measures for the classified contract.

### Appendix  C  

####to Security Procedures for Industrial Operations between the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands and the Department of Defense of the United States (Security Protocol)

###Reciprocal industrial security arrangements

1. Purpose This Appendix establishes arrangements whereby: 

a) A contractor facility in the Netherlands which is under the ownership, control or influence of a United States (U.S.) entity, may be declared eligible for access to Netherlands classified information; <sup>  FOCI (foreign ownership, control or influence) is defined in DoD Industrial Security Regulation No. 5220.22-R.  </sup>  

b) A contractor facility in the U.S. which is under the ownership, control or influence of a Netherlands entity, may be declared eligible for access to U.S. classified information; <sup>  FOCI (foreign ownership, control or influence) is defined in DoD Industrial Security Regulation No. 5220.22-R.  </sup>  

c) A Netherlands national may be granted a personnel security clearance to work on classified contracts in the U.S., or in connection with the granting of a U.S. facility clearance . <sup>  These procedures apply only to citizens of the Netherlands who are working in the U.S. The procedures will not apply to citizens of the Netherlands who have been admitted to the U.S. under an immigration visa for permanent residence and are cleared in the status of an immigrant alien under the U.S. Defense Industrial Security Program. In such cases a personnel security clearance may be granted by appropriate U.S. authorities.  </sup>  

d) A U.S. national may be granted a personnel security clearance to work on classified contracts in the Netherlands, or in connection with the granting of a Netherlands facility clearance . <sup>  Except for U.S. citizens who reside in the Netherlands, this excludes individuals whose permanent residence is outside the U.S., Puerto Rico, Panama Canal Zone or a U.S. possession or trust territory.  </sup>    

2. Application and Scope 

a) This Appendix applies to contractor facilities and individuals in the Netherlands and in the U.S. engaged in contracts involving classified information.  

b) This Appendix does not apply to RESTRICTED DATA as defined in the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to FORMELY RESTRICTED DATA removed from the RESTRICTED DATA category pursuant to Section 142 (d) of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to communications security information, to information for which foreign dissemination has been prohibited in whole or in part, to information for which a special access authorization is required and to information which is not authorized for release under the applicable national disclosure policies of either government.  

c) The provision for a security assurance for Netherlands or U.S. nationals shall not apply to an individual who, within the last fifteen years or since age sixteen, has resided in a country where neither the Netherlands nor the U.S. has investigative resources, or where it may reasonably be expected that the governmental authorities of that country would not cooperate in the investigation or in providing information.    

3. General Responsibilities 

a) The reponsible Netherlands agency for carrying out the terms of this arrangement is the cognizant military intelligency service; the responsible U.S. agency is the Defense Investigative Service (DIS). These agencies are designated as the government channels for exchanging facility clearance information, issuing security assurances, and granting Reciprocal Industrial Security Clearances.  

b) Each agency is responsible for ascertaining the clearance status of a contractor facility within its country when requested by the other agency, and for furnishing a written determination as to whether the contractor facility has the requisite facility security clearance in accordance with its security clearance requirements. Each agency is also responsible for ascertaining the clearance status of its nationals when requested by the other agency, and for providing a written determination to the other agency as to whether the individual has the requisite security clearance in accordance with its investigative and clearance requirements. A favorable determination in either instance is herafter referred to as a “security assurance”.  

c) The cognizant military intelligence service and DIS will ensure that each contractor facility has notified all of its employees who are granted a clearance based upon a security assurance, of their responsibilities for safeguarding classified information, regardless of which country classified the information. The notification will include indoctrination and periodic security briefings as to: 

(1) The need for protecting classified information and the adverse effects resulting form compromise.  

(2) The principles, criteria, and procedures for classification, downgrading, declassification, and marking information according to the respective governmental regulations.  

(3) The specific security requirements of the particular position.  

(4) The techniques employed by foreign intelligence operatives in attempting to obtain classified information and the responsibility for reporting such attempts.  

(5) The prohibition against disclosing classified information, by any means, to unauthorized persons or discussing or handling classified information in a manner that would make it accessible to unauthorized persons.  

(6) The penalties that may be imposed for unauthorized disclosure or other security breaches.      

4. Security Assurances for Contractors Facilities 

a) When a Netherlands contractor facility in the Netherlands requires access to Netherlands classified information, but is under the ownership, control or influence of a U.S. entity, the Netherlands may request the U.S. to provide a security assurance. Similarly, when a U.S. contractor facility in the U.S. requires access to U.S. information, but is under the ownership, control or influence of a Netherlands entity, the U.S. may request the Netherlands to provide a security assurance. Each agency agrees to accept the security assurance of the other.  

b) Each designated government agency will ascertain the clearance status of its contractor facility, and furnish a security assurance if it meets the requisite standards. If the contractor facility does not have a facility clearance, or has a facility clearance for a classification category lower than that requested, it will notify the other agency that the security assurance cannot be issued immediately, but that action is being taken to process the request. If a favorable determination is made following completion of the investigation, a security assurance will be provided. The requesting agency will then issue a Reciprocal Industrial Security Facility Clearance.  

c) A contractor facility which is under the ownership, control or influence of a third country interest is not eligible for a security assurance. In each case when a security is issued, it shall contain a statement that the contractor facility in question is not under ownership, control or influence of a third country interest. Requests for exceptions to this requirement may be considered on a case-by-case basis in situations where the foreign ownership, control or influence involves a third country with which Reciprocal Industrial Security Agreements exist. The request for exception should identify the source, the amount, and other pertinent particulars of the foreign ownership, control or influence.  

d) Whenever information develops about a contractor facility which raises a question regarding its continued eligibility for access to classified information, the government receiving the assurance shall be promptly notified about the derogatory information, and any planned or completed action to investigate, or to suspend or revoke the facility clearance.  

e) Each designated agency reserves the right to request the other to review the security assurance issued in behalf of a contractor facility, provided the requesting agency states the reasons for the review. Upon completing the review, the requesting agency will be notified as to whether the assurance is reaffirmed or withdrawn, and facts supporting the decision.    

5. Security Assurances for Individuals 

a) When a Netherlands national requires a personnel security clearance to work on a classified contract in the U.S., or in connection with the granting of a facility clearance, the U.S. may request the Netherlands to provide a security assurance. Similarly, when a U.S. national requires a personnel security clearance to work on a classified contract in the Netherlands, or in connection with the granting of a facility clearance, the U.S. may be requested to provide a security assurance. If the national does not have a security clearance, or if his security clearance is for a classification category lower than requested, the government receiving the request shall conduct the necessary investigation and security evaluation.  

b) If a Netherlands national has resided in the U.S. for any significant period of his adult life, the cognizant military intelligence service may request DIS to investigate his activities during that period. In all cases, DIS will ensure that as a minimum a U.S. National Agency Check is conducted, and that the complete results of the investigation are forwarded to the cognizant military intelligence service. If a U.S. national has resided in the Netherlands for any significant period of his adult life, DIS may request the Director of Army Intelligence/Industral Security Section to investigate his activities during that period, and forward the complete results of the investigation to DIS.  

c) Upon receiving a security assurance from the designated agency that the foreign national meets the security standards of his government, a Reciprocal Industrial Security Personnal Clearance will be issued.  

d) If either government learns of derogatory information about an individual for whom a security assurance has been given, it shall notify promptly the other government of the nature of the information and the action it intends to take, or has taken. Also each government may request a review of the security assurance furnished by the other government, provided that the requesting government states is reason for making the request. The government conducting the review will notify the requesting government of the results, and the reason for its decision.  

e) If either government suspends or takes action to revoke the clearance of an individual concerning whom it furnished a security assurance, or suspends or takes action to revoke access which it granted to a national of the other government based upon a security assurance, the other government will be notified as to the action taken and the reasons underlying the action.       

### Appendix  D  

####to Security Procedures for Industrial Operations between the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands and the Department of Defense of the United States (Security Protocol)

###Transmission of classified material

Paragraph 2.e. of the Security Procedures for Industrial Operations Between the Ministry of Defense of the Netherlands and the Department of Defense of the United States (Security Protocol) provides that transmission of classified information shall be made only through representatives designated by each of the governments. This procedure is commonly known as transmission through government-to-government channels. The following information should be considered when implementing this requirement. The method of shipment and the channels to be employed in transmitting classified material between each government should, whenever possible, be specified in the Security Requirements Clause of the basic contract, subcontract, or precontract solicitation. The attached routing sheet for the transmittal of classified documents is provided as guidance to assist in the identification of acceptable channels for incorporation into the Security Reguirements Clause. This routing may also be used as a procedural guideline when the need arises to transmit documents in those instances where the pertinent aspects of the Security Requirements Clause are unclear or not specifically adressed. The channels described therein should not be considered as the preferred mode in all instances.

### Annex  VI  

####to Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United States of America concerning the Principles Governing Mutual Cooperation in the Research and Development, Production and Procurement of Defense Equipment, signed at The Hague on 24 August 1978

###Principles governing defense contract audit services

I. Introduction This annex supersedes Annex VI entered into between the governments of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United States, dated April 18, 1985, concerning Principles Governing Defense Contract Audit Services and sets forth the terms, conditions and procedures under which the participating governments will provide one another with defense contract audit services upon request in support of defense contracts, subcontracts, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Letters of Offer and Acceptance contemplated or executed under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  

II. General Principles The objective of this annex is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of audit services available to the participating governments. Either government may request audit services from the other government. Both governments agree to perform the audits requested by the other government or otherwise required by this audit annex. In the event conflicts arise between any aspect of this annex and the laws of either participating government, the laws shall prevail. With notice to the other participating government, the purchasing government may elect to perform a specific audit in unusual circumstances, such as when the performing government can not satisfy an unusually short due date for an audit report. Contract audit reports shall be advisory. The purchasing government shall retain authority and responsibility for negotiating acceptable prices and contract settlements with contractors. Purchases by the Netherlands under the FMS Program will be handled under the U.S. FMS procedures in existence at the time of acceptance of the FMS agreement. When performing an audit for the U.S., the Netherlands agrees to use current U.S. cost principles and applicable cost accounting standards. The Netherlands also agrees that the U.S. will use its own cost principles when performing an audit for the Netherlands. All audit reports will be written in English. Consistent with U.S. cost principles and applicable cost accounting standards, the performing government may use the same audit methods it customarily uses for its own contracts, and shall determine the organizations and personnel to be involved. Neither participating government shall duplicate or review the work of the other. The governments shall hold periodic discussions to evaluate the operational effectiveness of the reciprocal agreement. In addition, each government agrees that compliance with this audit annex will be evaluated at least once every three years by its own appropriate review and oversight organization. A copy of the results of such reviews shall be provided to the other government. Solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts shall contain suitable provisions to enable the participating governments to act for and on behalf of one another under this annex and shall authorize access to contractor facilities and records as necessary. Nothing in this annex is to be construed to limit a purchasing government's rights or remedies, including access to contractors records, as may be authorized by contract or the laws of the purchasing government.  

III. Scope of Audit Annex This annex encompasses audits in support of contracts and subcontracts for defense equipment and services contemplated or executed under the MOU and FMS letters of offer and acceptance. It does not cover audits for architecture and engineering, construction, base support, operation and maintenance, or banking services, nor does it cover audits of universities, and contractors solely in the business of supporting the U.S. presence in the Netherlands. For purposes of this annex, defense contract audit services shall include the following types of audits: *Forward Pricing Audits:* Review of proposals submitted in contemplation of a contract award or a contract modification, to determine the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of each proposed cost element. *Accounting System Audits:* Review of contractor accounting records, procedures, and systems to determine their accuracy, currency, completeness, and compliance with contract requirements. *Estimating System Audit:* Evaluation of cost estimating systems. *Post Award Audits:* Verify after contract award the currency, accuracy, and completeness of cost or pricing data submitted to the purchasing government as of the completion of negotiations. Post award audits shall be automatically performed; that is, without a request, by both governments whenever a contract or contract modification has been awarded that exceeds the then current U.S. threshold for mandatory post award audits (the current threshold is $ 50,000,000) and the purchasing government relied upon certified cost or pricing data submitted by a contractor. For contract awards less than this threshold, in which the purchasing government relied upon certified cost or pricing data submitted by a contractor, post award audits will be performed based upon a sampling approach devised by the performing government or whenever there are indications that a post award audit is appropriate based on prior experience with a contractor. In addition, other post award audits will be performed upon request of the purchasing government. *Reimbursement Vouchers Audits:* Verify payment vouchers submitted under cost reimbursement contracts or other contracts with cost reimbursement features (e.g. material reimbursement) and recommend cost disallowances when appropriate. *Audits of Disclosed Accounting Practices:* Verify contractor compliance with disclosed accounting practices and contractual accounting requirements. *Overhead Cost Audits:* Evaluate overhead cost records prior to overhead settlements. *Termination Audits:* Evaluate proposed termination costs and contract cost records prior to termination settlements. *Final Pricing Audits:* Review and verify actual costs incurred in the performance of cost reimbursement and fixed price incentive contracts for purposes of establishing the final cost or price. *Other:* Audit services considered necessary and requested by contracting country.  

IV. Procedures Requests for contract audit services in the Netherlands shall be sent with a copy of the contractor's proposal (if applicable) by air mail to: Defense Contract Management Command, International Brussels/D APO New York, NY 09667-6207 A copy of each audit request shall be forwarded directly by air mail to: The Ministry of Defense Director Audit Agency Postbus 20701 2500 ES The Hague The Netherlands All requests for audits in the Netherlands will also be sent by telephonic facsimile to the following: DCMR, International – Brussels/D Facsimile Telephone Number: *32 2 6487401* Ministry of Defense, Director Audit Agency Facsimile Telephone Number: *31 70 3187596* Requests for contract audit services in the United States shall be sent by telephonic facsimile, followed by written request with a copy of the proposal (if applicable) sent by air mail, to: Defense Contract Management Area Office, New York DoD Central Control Point 201 Varick St. New York, NY 10014-4811 USA Facsimile Telephone Number *(212) 807-3343* Requests for audits shall specify the type of audit services needed, the contractor, the contractor's address, the subcontractor and address (if applicable), the proposal (if one is to be audited), any items requiring special review, the calendar date (not the number days after receipt of audit request) that the audit is needed by, a point of contact, telephone number, and facsimile telephone number. Acceptance of requests shall be acknowledged by telephonic facsimile by the performing government and a point of contact, telephone number, and facsimile number shall be provided. Each government agrees to establish a liaison person for this audit annex. The liaison office, liaison person, and telephone number shall be identified in each audit report. The liaison person shall assist in obtaining clarifications of audit requests or audit reports whenever necessary. The liaison person shall also assist in resolving problems with the timeliness, content, or quality of audit reports. If unable to resolve such problems, the issue will be escalated to successive managers (up to, in the Netherlands, the Director, Material Acquisition, Ministry of Defense, or, in the U.S., the Director, Foreign Contracting, Office of the Secretary of Defense). Each government agrees to provide audit reports in a timely manner. Audit reports submitted in accordance with the requested due dates, which for forward pricing audits is generally 45 days after receipt of request for audit, are timely. If the due date specified by the requesting government cannot be met, the performing government shall contact the point of contact identified in the audit request to explain the reasons for the delay. If the failure to meet the requested due date is caused by external factors, not within the control of the government performing the audit (such as not obtaining necessary cost data from a contractor), the purchasing government shall attempt to assist in resolving the problem and grant reasonable extensions as appropriate. If the inability to meet the requested due date is caused by action or inaction of the performing government, the issue will be escalated to the attention of the audit annex liaison person and to successive managers. The participating governments shall provide each other with access to all available information concerning contractor cost estimating systems and disclosed accounting practices when needed to support contract negotiations or enforcement. It is expected that contracts requiring the disclosure of accounting practices shall normally authorize contractors to file such disclosures with their own governments. In the United States, the files shall be maintained by the office administering the contract. In the Netherlands, the files shall be maintained by the Director of the Audit Agency. In order that the equity of this annex may be periodically appraised, information copies of all requests for audit by both countries will be sent to Defense Contract Audit Agency, European Branch office, Lindsey Air Station, APO New York 09633. To facilitate these periodic reviews, both governments agree to maintain a list of all audits performed for each other and the specific office that requested the audit shall be identified in such list.  

VI. Content of Audit Reports All audit reports shall describe the type, scope, depth of the evaluation performed, and a point of contact with a telephone number. The audit reports shall describe what was reviewed or evaluated, the methodology used to perform the review, findings of the review, recommendations of the auditor, and the basis for the recommendations. The audit report shall address any areas that were specifically requested for review. Each audit report shall state that the proposal was audited for unallowable costs and identify any unallowable costs. While audits requested pursuant to this agreement will not encompass investigations, audits shall be performed in a manner that will provide reasonable assurance of detecting errors, irregularities, abuse, or illegal acts that: (1) could have a direct (or indirect) and material effect on contractor financial representations or the results of financial related audits; or (2) significantly affect the audit objectives. The audit report should identify the extent to which issues raised by the auditor were discussed with the contractor. Supporting evaluations by technical and other specialists shall be included in the reports as appropriate. The purchasing government may request additional clarifications or supporting data if necessary, and shall have the final authority to determine when the information provided is adequate for its purposes. For forward pricing audits, the reports shall, for each element of proposed cost, identify the offeror's proposed cost, the basis for the proposed cost, how the auditor evaluated it, any recommended exceptions (questioned costs), and rationale supporting the recommended exceptions (questioned costs). The information supplied in the audit report should be sufficiently detailed to permit the purchasing government to develop and justify negotiation position.  

VII. Protection of Information Information obtained through the implementation of this annex shall receive the same protection against unauthorized disclosure as it would normally receive under the laws and rules of the participating government which possesses it.  

VIII. Charges Services will be provided under this annex without charge for all defense contracts, subcontracts, and FMS Letters of Offer and Acceptance entered into on or after the date of implementation of this annex provided that a joint review of the services being exchanged between the participating governments performed at not less than three year intervals indicates that general reciprocity is being maintained. If after such joint review either government determines that charges will be necessary, they may be imposed after not less than one year advance notice. Should charges by the U.S. Government become necessary, FMS procedures then in effect will apply.  

IX. Duration This annex will remain in effect for a period as set forth in Article VII of the MOU and may be terminated under the conditions as set forth in that article.    *For the Government of the Kingdom of The Netherlands*  (sd.)

####Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United States of America concerning the Principles Governing Mutual Cooperation in the Research and Development, Production, and Procurement of Defense Equipment, signed 24 August 1978

###Principles governing a scientist and engineer exchange program

I. Introduction This Annex sets forth the terms, conditions and procedures which shall govern a scientist and engineer exchange program (“the Exchange Program”) between The Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom of The Netherlands (“NL MOD”) and the Department of Defense of the United States (“US DOD”), hereafter referred to as “The Parties”. Professional knowledge of both Parties shall be shared for maximum mutual benefits to the extent authorized by the policies, laws and regulations of the United States and The Netherlands.  

II. General Principles In order to implement the Exchange Program, the Parties agree to provide on-site working assignments to selected scientists and engineers from the other Party (hereafter referred to as “the Exchange Personnel”) in US DOD and NL MOD research, development and logistics facilities. The work assignments shall provide Exchange Personnel with knowledge of the organization and management of Host Party research and development activities related to conventional military systems. This Exchange Program shall not include technical training nor is it to be used as a mechanism for obtaining technical data related to the design, development and manufacture of military systems. Exchange of scientists and engineers under this Annex shall be conducted on a reciprocal basis so that value to each Party shall be essentially equal. The Exchange Program shall be administered by Executive Agents. The Executive Agent for the US DOD is the Department of the Army; for the NL MOD, the Executive Agent is the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). The program shall be administered in compliance with Appendix A.  

III. Selection and Assignment of Candidates Participation in the Exchange Program is restricted to military officers and civilian employees of the US DOD and the NL MOD and to employees of the Netherlands Organization For Applied Scientific Research TNO and National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR) and the Maritime Research Institute of the Netherlands (MARIN) working on behalf of the MOD. The placement of each candidate nominated under this program is conditional upon the ability of the Host Party to provide work assignments commensurate with the purpose and scope of the program for a mutually agreed period. Candidates should hold at least a baccalaureate degree in a scientific field and should have at least two years practical experience in the technical area related to the position to which they are assigned. Some exchanges, however, may require higher academic qualifications. To assist in the evaluation and selection of candidates, the NL MOD and the US DOD shall provide background resumes, areas of interest, and assignment objectives for each candidate, following the format of Attachment 1 of Appendix A, at least 12 months prior to the desired date of assignment. It shall be the responsibility of the Host Party Executive Agent to provide, within 6 months of the desired date of assignment, a position description for available positions. The position description shall follow the outline at Attachment 2 of Appendix A. Final selection of candidates, and their assignment to a position nominated by the Host Party, shall be by mutual agreement between the NL MOD and the US DOD. Exchange Personnel shall not act in a liaison capacity or otherwise act as representatives of their respective Party or government while assigned to an exchange position, nor shall they act as representatives of the Host Party or Host Government or the facility to which they are assigned. They shall perform functions only as described in the position description of the position to which assigned.  

IV. Costs Costs incurred as a result of the participation of Exchange Personnel under this Annex shall be borne by the Party providing the Exchange Personnel (the “Parent Party”), to the extent authorized by the governing laws and regulations of the Parent Party, or by the Exchange Personnel themselves. Except as provided below, the Host Party shall not be responsible under this Annex for any of the expenses or costs of Exchange Personnel from the other Party. Travel and per diem costs associated with travel performed in connection with assigned duties within the Host Country shall be paid by the Party requesting or directing such travel.  

V. Security During the selection process, each Party shall inform the other of the level of security clearance required, if any, to permit candidates access to classified information. Access to classified information shall be kept to the minimum required to accomplish the work assignment as determined by the Host Party based on the position description. Each Party shall because to be filed, through The Netherlands Embassy in Washington, D.C., in the case of the NL MOD, and through the U.S. Embassy in The Hague, in the case of US DOD, the appropriate security assurances for each selected candidate. The security assurances shall be prepared and forwarded through prescribed channels in compliance with established Host Government and Host Party visit and accreditation procedures. Exchange Personnel shall at all times be required to comply with security laws, regulations and procedures of the Host Government and Host Party. Any violation of security procedures by exchange personnel during his/her assignment shall be reported to the Party of origin for appropriate action. All classified items, plans, specifications, or other information to which personnel participating in this program may have access shall be subject to all provisions and safequards provided for under the U.S./Netherlands General Security of Information Agreement, dated 18 August 1960 as amended 6 April 1981, and including the Industrial Security Annex thereto. The Host Party and Parent Party shall ensure that all assigned Exchange Personnel are fully cognizant of applicable security laws and regulations concerning the protection of proprietary information (such as patents, copyrights, and trade secrets), classified information and other information to be disclosed under this program, both during and after termination of a participant's assignment. The data and information to be exchanged under this Exchange Program, as well as access to facilities, equipment and sites shall not extend to the release of RESTRICTED DATA or FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA as defined in the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended; to communications security information; to information for which foreign dissemination has been prohibited in whole or in part; to information for which a special access authorization is required; or to information which has not been specifically authorized for release to the Parent Government of the Exchange Personnel under applicable disclosure policies of the Host Government and Host Party. To ensure the protection of proprietary, classified, and other information disclosed under this program, both during and after termination of a participant's assignment, all Exchange Personnel shall be advised of applicable security regulations and statutes and shall be required, prior to arrival in the Host Country, to sign the applicable agreements at Appendices B and C.  

VI. Technical and Administrative Matters To the extent authorized by its governing laws and regulations, the Host Party shall provide to Exchange Personnel, such administrative support as is deemed necessary for the efficient perfomance of their assigned tasks. To the exent authorized by the Host Party's governing laws and regulations, Exchange Personnel shall be subject to the same restrictions, conditions and privileges as Host Party NL MOD/US DOD personnel of comparable rank in the area of assignment. Further, to the extent authorized by the governing laws and regulations of the Host Party and applicable international agreements between the Parties, Exchange Personnel and their authorized dependents shall be accorded on a reciprocal basis: 

a) Exemption from any tax by the Host Party's government upon income received from the Parent Party's government.  

b) Exemption from any customs and import duties or similar charges levied on articles entering the Host country for their official or personal use, including, inter alia, their baggage, household effects, and private motor vehicles. The foregoing does not in any way limit privileges set forth elsewhere in this Annex, or other privileges granted by the laws and regulations of the Host Government or Host Party.   Exchange Personnel and their authorized dependents shall be briefed regarding their specific entitlements, privileges, and obligations prior to or immediately following their arrival in the Host country. The briefing shall include the subjects described at Attachment 3 to Appendix A. As a general rule, except for religious holidays, Exchange Personnel shall observe holidays of the Host government rather than their own national holidays. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the facility to which the Exchange Personnel are assigned. All Exchange Personnel shall work under the guidance and control of a Host Party supervisor who shall, after three months and upon completion of a participant's tour of duty, submit an evaluation report through the Executive Agent to the participant's Parent Party. Supervisors will ensure daily observation of each participant's performance in order to provide a basis for counselling and reporting. The status of Exchange Personnel while in the Host country shall be governed by the Agreement Between the Parties to the North Atlantic Treaty Regarding the Status of Their Forces (NATO SOFA) signed June 19, 1951, and related bilateral agreements between the Parties. Where applicable, claims against either Party or their personnel shall be handled in accordance with Article VIII of the NATO SOFA.  

VII. Inventions and Technical Information The respective rights of the Exchange Personnel and the two Parties to inventions (whether patentable or non-patentable) made (either conceived or reduced to practice) and to technical information developed by an exchange scientist or engineer during the period of and as a result of his/her participation in the program shall be governed by the laws and regulations of the respective parent government of exchange personnel. To the extent that the right, title, and/or interest to an invention and/or to technical information is assigned to the Parent Party under the provision of the preceding paragraph, the Parent Party grants free of charge of the Host Party for its own governmental purposes a non transferable, world-wide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to practice (make, use and sell) such inventions and to have unlimited use and reproduction rights in such technical information. Additional rights to inventions and technical information, such as transfer of patents, may be negotiated between the Parties. Notwithstanding the rights delineated in the paragraphs above, the Parent Party shall obtain from each exchange scientist and engineer, as a condition for participating in the program, a written commitment regarding inventions and technical information in the form prescribed in Appendix B and shall promptly deliver the signed originals to the Host Party prior to the arrival of the exchange scientist or engineer in the Host Country. The Parent Party of a scientist or engineer who makes an invention shall have first priority to prosecute or to have prosecuted on its behalf patent applications to secure rights granted under this section. The Parent Party shall, within a reasonable time, notify the Host Party of the countries in which it or the scientist or engineer inventor elects to file patent applications. To the extent consistent with other applicable international agreements for all other countries, the Host Government may prosecute or have prosecuted on its behalf patent applications to secure rights. Any additional compensation or award under an incentive award program or similar program due to the participant scientist or engineer for the work performed under this program shall be the responsibility of the Parent Party.  

VIII. Duration and Termination This Annex shall enter into force upon signature and shall remain in force for a period as set forth in Article VII of the MOU and may be terminated under the conditions as set forth in that article.    *For the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands*  (sd.)
