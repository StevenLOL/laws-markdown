### Nr.  I  

CANADIAN EMBASSY No. 101 The Hague, December 9, 1949 Excellency, With reference to the conversations which have taken place recently between officers of this Mission and representatives of your Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the modification of the non-immigrant visa agreement with the Netherlands, I have the honour to inform you that the Canadian Government is prepared to conclude with the Government of the Netherlands a new agreement in the following terms: 

1. Citizens of the Netherlands, who are bona fide non-immigrants coming to Canada from the Netherlands and who are in possession of valid national passports, will receive from competent Canadian diplomatic or consular authorities visas, free of charge, valid for an unlimited number of entries to Canada during a period of twelve months from the date of issue of such visas.  

2. Canadian citizens, who are bona fide non-immigrants and who are in possession of valid national passports, may, without previously obtaining a Netherlands visa, visit the Netherlands for periods each not exceeding three consecutive months.  

3. It is understood that this modification of entrance requirements does not exempt citizens of the Netherlands and Canadian citizens, coming respectively to Canada and the Netherlands, from the necessity of complying with the laws and regulations of the country concerned regarding the entry, residence (temporary or permanent) and employment or occupation of foreigners, and that persons, who are unable to satisfy the immigration authorities that they comply with these laws and regulations, are liable to be refused leave to enter or land.   If the Government of the Netherlands is prepared to accept the foregoing provisions, the Canadian Government has the honour to suggest that the present Note and the reply thereto of the Government of the Netherlands shall constitute an agreement between the two Governments which shall take effect on the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 1950. Accept, Excellency, the renewed assurances of my highest consideration. PIERRE DUPUY *Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands*
