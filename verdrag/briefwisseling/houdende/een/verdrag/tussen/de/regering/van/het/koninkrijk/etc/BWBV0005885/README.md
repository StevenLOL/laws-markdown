The purpose of the meeting is to provide an international forum to review and exchange international and national assessment results. The following objectives will be implemented during the meeting: 

– to share international experiences and lessons learned, as well as to exchange views on methods and strategies to implement recommendations drawn in the assessments;  

– to develop strategy and guidance for verification of effectiveness of implementation; and  

– to strengthen the international networking of operational and regulatory specialists in the analysis of the Fukushima accident.   Approximately 28 persons from 28 nominating countries and 2 international organizations are expected to attend, as well as representative(s) from the IAEA. Informal discussions held with Mr Marc Noel, Nuclear Programme Coordinator, Institute for Energy and Transport, Joint Research Centre-European Commission (JRC-EC), Westerduinweg 3, P.O.

The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Government) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA and participants officially designated to attend the meeting in their official capacities, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities contained in the Agreement on the Privileges and lmmunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.

Annex A contains the list of Member States and international organizations to be invited to participate in the meeting. The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the meeting. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the meeting, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow them to attend the meeting.  

3. The Government will facilitate customs formalities for the persons referred to above when they enter and leave the Netherlands.  

4. The Government will, at no cost to the IAEA, make adequate and appropriate premises and facilities available for the entire duration of the meeting as listed in Annex B.
