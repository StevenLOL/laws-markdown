INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY Vienna, 8 October 2012 In reply please refer to: 652-T2-TR45278 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is planning to hold a Training Meeting/Workshop on Naturally Radioactive Occurring Materials (NORM), from 28 January to 1 February 2013. The purpose of the training meeting/workshop is to present and discuss the developed solutions in the Netherlands for radiological as well as toxic problems of different NORM materials. Approximately 70 persons from 76 nominating countries are expected to attend, as well as representative(s) from the IAEA. Informal discussions held with Mr Leo van Velzen from the Nuclear Research & Consultancy Group (NRG) (Tel: +31 263568593, Email: vanvelzen@nrg.eu) have indicated that suitable premises and facilities could be made available at the premises of NRG in Petten, the Netherlands. I have the honour to enquire whether your Government would wish to host this training meeting/workshop and, if so, whether your Government would agree to make the following arrangements: 

1. The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Government) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA and participants officially designated to attend the training meeting/workshop in their official capacities, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities contained in the [Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/agreement/on/the/privileges/and/immunities/of/the/international/atomic/etc/BWBV0004919/README.md), which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.  

2. The Government will accord to the officials and participants mentioned above every facility necessary for the performance of their functions in connection with the training meeting/workshop, including entering, remaining in and leaving the Netherlands. The Government will issue any necessary visas as expeditiously as possible and, where the legislation of the Netherlands permits, free of charge. The Government, however, reserves the right to deny, irrespective of nationality, visas to individual participants for national security reasons. Annex A contains the list of Member States to be invited to participate in the training meeting/workshop. The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the training meeting/workshop. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the training meeting/workshop, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow them to attend the meeting/workshop.  

3. The Government will facilitate customs formalities for the persons referred to above when they enter and leave the Netherlands.  

4. The Government will, at no cost to the IAEA, make adequate and appropriate premises and facilities available for the entire duration of the training meeting/workshop as listed in Annex B.  

5. The Government will exercise reasonable care to ensure security on the premises where the training meeting/workshop takes place and to ensure the safety of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 above while they are on those premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonable in the circumstances to ensure such security and safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.   Mr Horst Monken Fernandes of the Division of Nuclear Fuel Cycle and Waste Technology has been appointed Scientific Secretary of the training meeting/workshop. Should your Government wish to host this training meeting/workshop, I would be grateful if you would inform me in writing of your Government's agreement to the above enumerated points by 24 October 2012 so as to enable the Secretariat to proceed with timely arrangements. Accept, Sir, the assurances of my highest consideration.
