### Nr.  I  

INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY Vienna, 4 August 2011 In reply please refer to: JO-TR-41633/NSF11161 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is planning to hold a Regional Training Course on Physical Protection Against Sabotage: Assessing Vulnerabilities and Identifying Vital Areas from 17 to 21 October 2011. The purpose of the training course is to assist Member States in enhancing and maintaining their physical protection (PP) regime, in particular, preventive and protective measures against sabotage of nuclear facilities, assessing vulnerabilities of PP systems of the facilities and identifying vital areas, sabotage of which could lead to high radiological consequences. Approximately 40 persons from 16 countries are expected to attend as well as representative(s) from the IAEA. Informal discussions held with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment have indicated that suitable premises and facilities could be made available in The Hague. I have the honour to enquire whether your Government would wish to host this course and, if so, whether your Government would agree to make the following arrangements: 

1. The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Government) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA, lecturers, invited speakers and participants officially designated to attend the course in their official capacities, and to observers, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities contained in the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.  

2. The Government will accord to the persons mentioned above every facility necessary for the performance of their functions in connection with the course, including entering, remaining in and leaving the Netherlands. The Government will issue any necessary visas as expeditiously as possible and, where the legislation of the Netherlands permits, free of charge. The Government, however, reserves the right to deny, irrespective of nationality, visas to individual participants for national security reasons. Annex A contains the list of Member States to be invited to participate in the course. The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the course. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the course, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow them to attend the course.  

3. The Government will facilitate customs formalities for the persons referred to above when they enter and leave the Netherlands.  

4. The Government will, at no cost to the IAEA, make adequate and appropriate premises and facilities available for the entire duration of the course as listed in Annex B.  

5. The Government will exercise reasonable care to ensure security on the premises where the course takes place and to ensure the safety of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 above while they are on those premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonable in the circumstances to ensure such security and safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.
