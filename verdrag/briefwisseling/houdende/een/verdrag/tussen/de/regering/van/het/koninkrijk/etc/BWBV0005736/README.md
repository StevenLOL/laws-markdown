INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY In reply please refer to: C1-RER/1/007/9002/01 2012-02-14 Subject: Request to the Government of the Netherlands to host a Regional Workshop on Intercomparison Feedback of Neutron Activation Analysis Proficiency Tests Performed in 2011-2012 in Delft, Netherlands, from 22 to 25 May 2012 Sir, I have the honour to refer to earlier consultations, at the technical level, between the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and representatives of your Government concerning the organization of the above workshop from 22 to 25 May 2012 within the framework of the IAEA technical cooperation project RER/1/007 “Enhancing Use and Safety of Research Reactors through Networking, Coalitions and Shared Best Practices. The purpose of the workshop is to: (i) present status reports of the NAA proficiency tests performed in 2011-2012 under RER4032; (ii) with the help of experts, analyse the results and identify sources of errors; (iii) discuss the lessons learned and suggest remedies to improve the forthcoming NAA and other analytical techniques proficiency tests scheduled in 2012-2013; and (iv) draft the workshop report and formulate recommendations. Approximately 25 persons from 11 countries are expected to attend, as well as representative(s) from the IAEA. I have the honour to enquire whether your Government would wish to host this workshop and, if so, whether your Government would agree to make the following arrangements: 

1. The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as the Government) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA and participants officially designated to attend the workshop in their official capacities, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities contained in the [Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency](../../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/agreement/on/the/privileges/and/immunities/of/the/international/atomic/etc/BWBV0004919/README.md), which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.  

2. The Government will accord to the officials and participants mentioned above every facility necessary for the performance of their functions in connection with the workshop, including entering, remaining in and leaving the Netherlands. The Government will issue any necessary visas as expeditiously as possible and, where the legislation of the Netherlands permits, free of charge. The Government, however, reserves the right to deny, irrespective of nationality, visas to individual participants for national security reasons. Annex A contains the list of Member States to be invited to participate in the workshop. The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the workshop. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the workshop, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow them to attend the workshop.  

3. The Government will facilitate customs formalities for the persons referred to above when they enter and leave the Netherlands as well as for the publications and other material being provided by the IAEA.  

4. The Government will, at no cost to the IAEA, make adequate and appropriate premises, personnel and facilities available for the entire duration of the workshop.  

5. The Government will exercise reasonable care to ensure security on the premises where the workshop takes place and to ensure the safety of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 above while they are on those premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonable in the circumstances to ensure such security and safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.   With regard to the organization and conduct of the workshop, I wish to propose the arrangements as set out in Annex B which forms an integral part of the agreement. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr Peter Bode, TU Delft / Delft University of Technology, who has so far been our principal contact regarding the workshop. Should your Government wish to host this workshop, I would be grateful if you would inform me in writing of your Government’s agreement to the above enumerated points, as well as the name of the designated workshop organizer and finance officer, by 2 March 2012 so as to enable the Secretariat to proceed with timely arrangements.
