### Nr.  I  

INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY Vienna, 21 January 2013 In reply please refer to: 02.94 NSF12201/J0-TR-45660 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is planning to hold a Regional Training Course on Introduction to Nuclear Forensics from 28 to 30 May 2013 in The Hague, Netherlands. The purpose of the course is to familiarize participants with the role of nuclear forensics in the context of a national response plan to prevent and respond to incidents of nuclear and other radioactive material out of regulatory control, as well as with the requirements for, and the conduct of, a nuclear forensic examination. Approximately 30 persons from 27 nominating countries are expected to attend, as well as representatives from the lAEA and its expert partners to include those from the United States of America and the European Commission. Informal discussions held with Mr Ed van Zalen from the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) have indicated that suitable premises and facilities could be made available in The Hague, Netherlands. I have the honour to enquire whether your Government would wish to host this course and, if so, whether your Government would agree to make the following arrangements: 

1. The Government of the Netherlands (hereinafter referred to as “the Government”) will accord to the IAEA, its property, funds and assets, and to the officials of the IAEA, lecturers and participants officially designated to attend the course in their official capacities, and to members of the immediate families of such persons, the privileges and immunities provided for by the [Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency](../../../../../../../../../../../../verdrag/agreement/on/the/privileges/and/immunities/of/the/international/atomic/etc/BWBV0004919/README.md) which was accepted by the Government on 29 August 1963.  

2. The Government will accord to officials and participants mentioned above every facility necessary for the performance of their function in connection with the training course, including entering, remaining in and leaving the Netherlands. The Government will issue any necessary visas as expeditiously as possible and, where the legislation of the Netherlands permits, free of charge. The Government, however, reserves the right to deny, irrespective of nationality, visas to individual participants for national security reasons. Annex A contains the list of Member States to be invited to participate in the course. The IAEA will inform the Government promptly of all persons officially designated to attend the course. The IAEA will also advise such persons to apply for visas, if necessary, in good time before the opening date of the course, and the Government is expected to issue such visas promptly so as to allow participants to attend the course.  

3. The Government will facilitate customs formalities for the persons referred to above when they enter and leave the Netherlands.  

4. The Government will make adequate and appropriate premises and facilities available for the entire duration of the course as listed in Annex B.  

5. The Government will exercise reasonable care to ensure security on the premises in which the training course takes place and to ensure the safety of the persons mentioned in paragraph 1 above while they are on those premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonable in the circumstances to ensure such security and safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.   Mr David Kenneth Smith of the Office of Nuclear Security (email: d.smith@iaea.org) has been appointed Scientific Secretary to the course. Ms Baan Fischer of the Office of Nuclear Security (email: b.fischer@iaea.org) will provide the administrative organization of the course. Should your Government wish to host this course, I would be grateful if you would inform me in writing of your Government’s intention to give effect to the above enumerated points, by 18 February 2013 so as to enable the Secretariat to proceed with timely arrangements.
