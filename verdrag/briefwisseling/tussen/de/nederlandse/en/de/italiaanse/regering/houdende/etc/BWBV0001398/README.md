1.  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the liaison officer and members of his family who form part of his household and do not possess Dutch nationality, shall enjoy in and vis-à-vis the Kingdom of the Netherlands the same privileges and immunities as are conferred on members of the diplomatic staff by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961.   
2.  The immunity granted to persons mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not extend to either: 

(i) civil action by a third party for damages, including personal injury or death, arising from a traffic accident caused by any such person, and is without prejudice to Article 32 of the Europol Convention; or

####Entry, stay and departure

The liaison officer shall have the right to use codes and to dispatch and receive official correspondence and other official communications by courier or in sealed bags which shall be subject to the same privileges and immunities as diplomatic couriers and bags.   
2.  The liaison officer shall, as far as may be compatible with the International Telecommunications Convention of 6 November 1982, for his official communications enjoy treatment not less favourable than that accorded by the Kingdom of the Netherlands to any international organisation or government, in the matter of priorities for communication by mail, cable, telegraph, telex, radio, television, telephone, fax, satellite, or other means.

Each party shall appoint one arbitrator. The third, who shall be chairman of the tribunal, is to be chosen by the first two arbitrators.
