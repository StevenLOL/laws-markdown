### Nr.  I  

###ROYAL NETHERLANDS EMBASSY

February 17, 1967 Excellency, In view of the present difficulties with regard to the food situation in certain Indian States and with reference to the recent discussions between representatives of the Government of the Netherlands and the Government of India, I have the honour, on behalf of my Government, to propose the following: 

1. The Netherlands Government shall contribute towards the development of the food grain production in the talukas of Karmala, Madha and Sangola in the District of Sholapur of Maharashtra State by making available chemical fertilisers, urea: 1820 ton and double super phosphate: 300 ton, on C & F basis at Bombay Port at a cost not exceeding N.F1. 800,000. The fertilisers will be used for growing hybrid jowar on approximately 5000 acres at the general rate of N 100 lbs. and P <sub>2</sub> O <sub>5</sub> 60 lbs. per acre and the remaining quantity will be used on approximately 33000 acres of ordinary jowar at the rate of N 40 lbs, per acre. The fertilisers will be used only under conditions of assured irrigation.  

2. The Government of India will take all measures necessary for the clearance and temporary storage at the port of arrival.  

3. The Government of India will also establish procedures for exempting the Netherlands Government from duties and taxes, imposed in India, on the fertilisers.  

4. The Government of India will take all measures necessary to transport materials from Bombay to Sholapur, for the distribution of the fertilisers, for making available hybrid seed, plant protection equipment, pesticide and the credit needs of the farmers.  

5. The proceeds from sales of the above mentioned fertilisers will be used in the selected areas for the following purposes: 

a) land development (levelling and bunding for irrigation);  

b) purchase of diesel pumps for lift irrigation schemes; and  

c) setting up a seed-processing plant.    

6. The Government of India will also permit a Netherlands expert to visit the area during harvest time after the application of the fertilisers, to study and evaluate the impact of the project.  

7. If the foregoing is acceptable to the Government of India, I have the honour to propose that this letter and your reply to that effect shall constitute an agreement between the Government of the Netherlands and the Government of India which shall come into force on the date of your reply and shall terminate on the date on which both parties have fulfilled all obligations arising from it.   I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you, Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration. (sd.) H. VAN RIJCKEVORSEL  *Ambassador of the Netherlands*   *His Excellency,*   *the Minister of External Affairs,*   *Government of India,*   *New Delhi.*
