##Briefwisseling tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Haagse Conferentie voor Internationaal Privaatrecht inzake het verlenen van nadere voorrechten en immuniteiten

### Nr.  I  

###MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Hague, 16 December 1992 Dear Mr Secretary General,I have the honour to refer to the discussions between you and representatives of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands concerning the addition of further privileges and immunities to those in the agreement constituted by the exchange of notes of 1 December 1959 (Dutch Treaties Series 1958, 181) between the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, regarding the privileges and immunities of the organs of the Conference.In the light of the understanding reached in those discussions, I have the honour to propose that the privileges and immunities as set out in the Annex be added to those in the agreement constituted by the exchange of notes of 1 December 1959.I have the honour to propose that if this is acceptable, this note and your note in reply indicating such acceptance shall constitute an agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Hague Conference on Private International Law, which shall enter into force on the date of receipt of your note in reply and shall be terminated in the event that the Permanent Bureau is transferred from the territory of the Netherlands.With respect to the Kingdom of the Netherlands the agreement constituted by this exchange of notes shall apply to the part of the Kingdom in Europe only.In explanation of the text of Point III of the Annex, the following is hereby confirmed:The proposed text is similar to the provisions of other agreements between the Netherlands and international organizations, having their seat in the Netherlands.The Netherlands Government is willing to exempt the personnel of international organizations and the members of their households from obligatory participation in the Netherlands social insurance schemes, taking into account that the social security coverage by the international organizations is comparable to the coverage offered by the Netherlands schemes. The Netherlands Government has given its consent for exempting the personnel of the Hague Conference by letter of 1 March 1967.This exemption will be maintained after the agreement constituted by this exchange of notes on immunities and privileges (with the text of Point III of the Annex) between the Netherlands and the Hague Conference has entered into force, notwithstanding the developments that have taken place in the Netherlands schemes ever since.The present Pension scheme rules of the Hague Conference, that entered into force on 1 June 1981, will also be deemed to offer comparable coverage.As was discussed on 6 October 1992 between you and representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and of Social Affairs and Employment, there is one point of concern on the matter for the Netherlands Government: the health insurance, i.e. the insurance for medical etc. care (benefits in kind) offered by the Hague Conference, does not contain the benefits covered under the Exceptional Medical Expenses Act (AWBZ), such as long term-hospitalization.It is advised to provide for supplementary insurance for your personnel in this respect.Please, Mr Secretary-General, accept the renewed assurances of my highest consideration.(sd.) H. VAN DEN BROEKH. van den Broek*Mr. G. A. L. Droz **Secretary-General of the** Hague Conference on **Private International Law **at The Hague*

a). In addition to the privileges and immunities accorded to staff members of the Permanent Bureau, the Secretary-General shall, together with members of the family forming part of his or her household, not being private servants, enjoy the privileges and immunities to which a head of a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands is entitled, unless he or she is a Netherlands national.

b)the arrival and final departure of members of the families forming part of the households of the persons referred to in paragraph (a) and, where appropriate, the fact that a person has ceased to form part of the household.

### III

b). The provisions of paragraph a) shall apply, *mutatis mutandis,* to the members of the family forming part of the households of the individuals referred to in paragraph a), unless they are employed in the Netherlands otherwise than by the Conference or unless they are in the domestic service of the aforesaid households.

### IV
