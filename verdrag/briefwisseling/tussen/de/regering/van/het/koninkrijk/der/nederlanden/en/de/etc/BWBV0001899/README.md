London, 8 November 1994 Your Excellency, On instructions from my Government, I have the honour to propose that the application of the European Convention on Extradition („the Convention") of 13 December 1957, in accordance with Article 27, paragraph 4 thereof, be extended to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba. The declarations and reservations made by the Kingdom of The Netherlands, in respect of the Kingdom in Europe, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on becoming parties to the Convention and which apply to extradition relations between them shall also apply to extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, except that the declaration concerning Articles 6 and 21 as made by the Kingdom of the Netherlands upon ratification and amended on 14 October 1987, relating to the extradition of Netherlands nationals, shall not apply to the Netherlands Antilles nor to Aruba respectively until such time as the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, concluded in Strasbourg on 21 March 1983, becomes applicable to each of them respectively. If this proposal is acceptable to the Government of the United Kingdom, I have the honour to propose that this letter and Your Excellency's reply to that effect shall constitute an Agreement between our two Governments which shall enter into force on the date on which each of our two Governments has notified the other of the completion of its internal procedures necessary to give effect to it. I have the honour to convey to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.   yours sincerely (sd.) R. H. LOUDON R. H. Loudon Chargé d'Affaires a.i.  *The Rt. Hon. Douglas Hurd*   *Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs*   *London*
