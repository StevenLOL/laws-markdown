### Nr.  I  

Brussels, May 26, 1969. My dear General, By your letter dated 12th December, 1966 you proposed a number of items which, in connection with the move of the Headquarters of the Allied Forces in Central Europe (AFCENT) to the Netherlands, should be added to the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and SHAPE of 25th May, 1964 or alternatively be agreed by exchange of letters. Those items concerned which affect existing Netherlands legislation and which, accordingly, have to be submitted for parliamentary approval, are dealt with in a separate exchange of notes of today's date. With regard to the remaining items proposed by you, my Government suggests the following arrangements:
