###MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Hague, 6 September 1990 Dear Mr President, Referring to the conversations between the Netherlands authorities and the Secretary-General of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal concerning the privileges and immunities with respect to the functioning of the Tribunal and to the wish expressed during these conversations on behalf of the Tribunal to specify these privileges and immunities, I have the honour hereby to propose to your Excellency the following:  

### Article  1  

1.  The premises of the Tribunal shall be inviolable. The Netherlands authorities may not enter them, except with the consent of the President of the Tribunal or of his designee. Such consent may, however, be assumed in case of fire or other disaster requiring prompt protective action, and only in the event that it has not been possible to obtain the express consent of the President or of his designee.   
2.  The Netherlands Government is under a special duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the premises of the Tribunal against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any disturbance of the peace of the Tribunal or impairment of its dignity.   
3.  The premises of the Tribunal, their furnishings and other property thereon shall be immune from search, requisition, attachment or execution.   
4.  Service of process at the premises of the Tribunal and service of any other procedural instruments relating to a cause of action against the Tribunal shall not constitute breach of inviolability.   

### Article  2  

The archives of the Tribunal and any documents belonging to or held by it shall be inviolable. They should, when necessary, bear visible external marks of identification.  

### Article  3  

1.  Subject to the provisions of Article 4 the Tribunal, within the scope of the performance of its tasks, shall enjoy in the Netherlands immunity from jurisdiction and execution, except: 

a. to the extent that the Tribunal shall have expressly waived such immunity in a particular case;  

b. in the case of a civil action brought by a third party for damage resulting from an accident caused by a motor vehicle belonging to, or operated on behalf of, the Tribunal, or in respect of a motor traffic offence involving such a vehicle.     
2.  The property and assets of the Tribunal, wherever situated, shall be immune from requisition or attachment.   
3.  The property and assets of the Tribunal shall also be immune from administrative or provisional judicial constraint, except in so far as may be temporarily necessary in connection with the prevention of, and investigation into, accidents involving motor vehicles belonging to or operated on behalf of the Tribunal.   

### Article  4  

1.  If the Tribunal institutes or intervenes in proceedings before a court in the Netherlands, it submits, for the purpose of those proceedings, to the jurisdiction of the Netherlands courts.   
2.  In such cases the Tribunal cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of a counterclaim if the counterclaim arises from the legal relationship or the facts on which the principal claim is based.   

### Article  5  

If the Tribunal appears before the courts in order to assert immunity, it shall not thereby be deemed to have waived immunity.  

### Article  6  

1.  The Netherlands Government shall permit and protect free communication on the part of the Tribunal for all official purposes, and notably with the Parties to the Claims Settlement Declaration.   
2.  The official correspondence of the Tribunal shall be inviolable. Official correspondence means all correspondence relating to the Tribunal and its functions.   

### Article  7  

The members of the Tribunal shall be inviolable. They shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. The Netherlands authorities shall treat them with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity.  

### Article  8  

1.  The private residence of a member of the Tribunal shall enjoy the same inviolability and protection as the premises of the Tribunal. The exception provided for by paragraph 4 of Article 1 shall be applicable mutatis mutandis.   
2.  The papers, correspondence and, except as provided for in paragraph 4 of Article 9, the property of a member of the Tribunal shall likewise enjoy inviolability.   

### Article  9  

1.  A member of the Tribunal shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

a. a real action relating to private immovable property situated in the Netherlands;  

b. an action relating to succession in which a member of the Tribunal is involved as executor, administrator, heir or legatee;  

c. an action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by a member of the Tribunal in the Netherlands outside his official function;

3.  A member of the Tribunal is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.

No measures of execution may be taken in respect of a member of the Tribunal except in the cases coming under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 2 of this Article, and provided that the measures concerned can be taken without infringing the inviolability of his person or of his residence.   

### Article  10

1.  The purpose of the privileges and immunities provided for in the present Articles is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the unimpeded functioning of the Tribunal.   
2.  The Tribunal may waive the immunity from jurisdiction of a member of the Tribunal and of the Secretary-General or of any person enjoying immunity under Articles 11 to 13. Immunity shall be waived in any case where, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the immunity would impede the course of justice and waiver would not prejudice the purpose for which the immunity is accorded.   
3.  Waiver must always be express.   
4.  The initiation of proceedings by any of the persons referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall preclude him from invoking immunity from jurisdiction in respect of any counter-claim directly connected with the principal claim.   
5.  Waiver of immunity from jurisdiction in respect of judicial proceedings shall not be held to imply waiver of immunity in respect of the execution of the judgement, for which a separate waiver shall be necessary.   

### Article  15  

1.  Every person entitled to privileges and immunities shall enjoy them from the moment he enters Netherlands territory for the purpose of performing his functions with the Tribunal or, if he is already in its territory, from the moment when his appointment is notified to the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.   
2.  When the functions of a person enjoying privileges and immunities have come to an end, such privileges and immunities shall normally cease at the moment when he leaves Netherlands territory, or on expiry of a reasonable period in which to do so, but shall subsist until that time, even in case of armed conflict. However in respect of acts performed by such a person in the exercise of his function, immunity shall continue to subsist.   
3.  In case of the death of a member of the Tribunal or of a staff-member of the Tribunal, the members of his family and his private servants shall continue to enjoy the privileges and immunities to which they are entitled until the expiry of a reasonable period in which to leave the Netherlands.   

### Article  16

However, the immunity with regard to the execution of the judgement will stand unless waived in accordance with Article 14.   

### Article  17A  

1.

Measures of execution in respect of members of the family forming part of the households of the Members and of the Secretary-General in matters arising in the course of or in connection with their gainful employment can only be taken if those measures do not infringe the inviolability of their person or of their residence, in as far as they are entitled to such inviolability.

In case of the insolvency of a person aged under 18 with respect to a claim arising out of gainful employment of that person under this Article, the immunity of the Member, the Secretary-General, or Staff member of the Tribunal of whose family the person concerned is a member shall be waived by the Tribunal for the purpose of settlement of the claim, in accordance with Article 14.
