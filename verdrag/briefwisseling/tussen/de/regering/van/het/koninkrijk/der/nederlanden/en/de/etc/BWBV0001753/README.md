###The Hague, 29–30 November 2005

Excellency, I have the honour to refer to the communication of 23 June 2005 from Dr Peter de Leeuw, Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, conveying your Government's willingness to provide host facilities for the Seventy-second Session of the Executive Committee of the European Commission for the control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EUFMD) in The Hague. It is proposed to hold the meeting on 29 and 30 November 2005. I very much appreciate the generous offer made by your Government. The Session is being convened under the provisions of Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. It is my intention to invite the Chairman of the Research Group of the Standing Technical Committee (Belgium), and all the members of the Executive Committee who are nationals of the following FAO Member Nations: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, The Netherlands, Romania and Turkey. An invitation to attend in an observer capacity will be sent to the European Community, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (WRLFMD). The total number of participants is expected to be between 15 and 20. The Session will be concluded in English. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the Session, I should appreciate it if your Government would undertake to apply the following provisions:  

### 1  

The Government will exercise all reasonable care to ensure security on the premises in which the Session takes place and to ensure the safety of the officials of FAO and participants concerned while on such premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonably required in the circumstances to ensure such security and such safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.  

### 2  

The Government recognizes that the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of 21 November 1947 (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘the Convention") will be applicable to the Session. Accordingly, representatives of Governments and officials of FAO performing official functions in connection with the Session will enjoy the privileges and immunities provided by Articles V and VI of the Convention. FAO declares that participants from organizations are experts on mission within the meaning of Annex II and VII to the Convention, and consequently it is agreed that they will enjoy the privileges and immunities provided by those Annexes.  

### 3  

Without prejudice to the provisions of the Convention, all persons performing functions in connection with the Session shall enjoy immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written in connection with their functions during the Session.  

### 4  

Grant visas and all necessary facilities to delegates, observers and consultants attending the Session, provided that the general conditions governing the granting of visas are fulfilled.  

### 5  

The Government will deal with any action, claim, or other demand against FAO or its personnel arising out of: 

(i) injury to person or damage to property in the premises provided for the Session;  

(ii) injury to person or damage to property incurred in using the transportation provided by the Government for the Session;  

(iii) the employment by the Government of temporary personnel for the Government. The Government will hold harmless FAO and its personnel in respect of any such action, claim or demand, unless these damages were caused by gross negligence or intentionally caused by personnel of FAO.    

### 6  

Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all participants enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the Netherlands. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Netherlands.  

### 7  

Any dispute concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, except for a dispute subject to the appropriate provisions of the Convention or of any other applicable agreement, will, unless the parties otherwise agree, be submitted to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one of whom will be appointed by the Director-General of FAO, one by the Government, and the third, who will be the chairman, by the other two arbitrators. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within three months of the other party having notified the name of its arbitrator, or if the first two arbitrators do not within three months of the appointment or nomination of the second one of them appoint the chairman, then such arbitrator will be nominated by the President of the International Court of Justice at the request of either party to the dispute. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the tribunal shall adopt its own rules of procedure, provide for reimbursement of its members and the distribution of expenses between the parties, and take all decisions by a two-thirds majority. Its decisions on all questions of procedure and substance shall be final and, even if rendered in default of one of the parties, be binding on both of them.  

### 8  

Nominate a Liaison Officer who will be responsible for the coordination of local facilities and arrangements for the Session.  

### 9  

Provide one meeting room with seating and table space for 20 persons, a photocopying machine and a PC loaded with Word 2000, with an international keyboard and linked to a laser printer.  

### 10  

Provide for transport within the Netherlands for participants and staff as required for the conduct of the Session.  
I should appreciate receiving your Government's acceptance, by letter or by telefax, of the above responsibilities, so that invitations and documents may be prepared and issued in good time. This letter and your reply will consitute the Agreement covering the Session. Accept, Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration. (sd) DAVID A. HARCHARIK David A.
