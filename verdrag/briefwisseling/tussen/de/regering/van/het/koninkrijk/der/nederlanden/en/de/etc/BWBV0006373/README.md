##Briefwisseling tussen de Regering van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Voedsel- en Landbouworganisatie van de Verenigde Naties (FAO) houdende een verdrag inzake de 29ste zitting van het FAO/WHO Coordinating Committee for Europe, te Den Haag, Nederland, van 30 september tot 3 oktober 2014

### Nr.  I  

FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Rome, 19 March 2014 Our Ref.: CX-706 (Agm) Twenty-ninth Session of the FAO/WHO Coordination Committee for Europe The Hague, 30 September – 3 October 2014 Excellency, I have the honour to refer to the letter of 29 October 2013 from the Director-General for Agro of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands, addressed to the Secretary of the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, conveying your Government’s willingness to provide host facilities for the Twenty-ninth Session of the FAO/WHO Coordinating Committee for Europe. It is proposed to hold the session in The Hague from 30 September to 3 October 2014. I very much appreciate the generous offer made by your Government. The Session is being convened within the framework of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Programme. It is intended to invite all Members of the FAOIWHO Codex Alimentarius Commission within the geographic location of Europe listed in Annex-A1, as well as the international organizations listed in Annex-B, who will attend as appropriate according to their specific field of interest. Any other Member of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Annex-A2) which does not belong to the geographic location of Europe may attend as an observer. Furthermore, other Member Nations or Associate Members of FAO and/or WHO, which are not members of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, or States which, while not Members of FAO or WHO, are members of the United Nations, as well as international organizations in relationship with FAO and/or WHO, may be represented by observers at the Session, should they so request. The total number of participants is expected to be about 150. The Session will be conducted in English, French, Spanish and Russian. FAO will be responsible for providing interpretation and translation services for English, French and Spanish, and the Host Government for Russian (see attached standards). In order to ensure the smooth functioning of the Session, I should appreciate it if your Government would undertake to apply the following provisions: 

1. The Government will exercise all reasonable care to ensure security on the premises in which the Session takes place and to ensure the safety of the officials of FAO and WHO and participants concerned while on such premises. The Government will take whatever steps may be reasonably required in the circumstances to ensure such security and such safety, including such supervision of the premises as may be warranted.  

2. The Government recognizes that the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies of 21 November 1947 (hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”) will be applicable to the Session. Accordingly, representatives of Governments and officials of FAO and WHO performing official functions in connection with the Session will enjoy the privileges and immunities provided by Articles V and VI of the Convention. FAO declares that participants from organizations listed in Annex B are experts on mission within the meaning of Annex II and VII to the Convention, and consequently it is agreed that they will enjoy the privileges and immunities provided by those Annexes.  

3. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Convention, all persons performing functions in connection with the Session shall enjoy immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or written in connection with their functions during the Session.  

4. Grant visas and all necessary facilities to delegates, observers and consultants attending the Session, provided that the general conditions governing the granting of visas are fulfilled.  

5. The Government will deal with any action, claim, or other demand against FAO, WHO or its personnel arising out of: 

(i) injury to person or damage to property in the premises provided for the Session;  

(ii) injury to person or damage to property incurred in using the transportation provided by the Government for the Session;  

(iii) the employment by the Government of temporary personnel for the Government.   The Government will hold harmless FAO and WHO and its personnel in respect of any such action, claim or demand, unless these damages were caused by gross negligence or intentionally caused by personnel of FAO or WHO.  

6. Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, it is the duty of all participants enjoying privileges and immunities to respect the laws and regulations of the Netherlands. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of the Netherlands.  

7. Any dispute concerning the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, except for a dispute subject to the appropriate provisions of the Convention or of any other applicable agreement, will, unless the parties otherwise agree, be submitted to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one of whom will be appointed by the Director-General of FAO, one by the Government, and the third, who will be the chairman, by the other two arbitrators. If either party does not appoint an arbitrator within three months of the other party having notified the name of its arbitrator, or if the first two arbitrators do not within three months of the appointment or nomination of the second one of them appoint the chairman, then such arbitrator will be nominated by the President of the International Court of Justice at the request of either party to the dispute. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the tribunal shall adopt its own rules of procedure, provide for reimbursement of its members and the distribution of expenses between the parties, and take all decisions by a two-thirds majority. Its decisions on all questions of procedure and substance shall be final and, even if rendered in default of one of the parties, be binding on both of them.   I should appreciate receiving your Government’s acceptance by email (Official-Correspondence-Group@fao.org) of the above responsibilities as soon as possible so that invitations and documents may be prepared and issued in good time. This letter and your reply will constitute the Agreement covering the Twenty-ninth Session of the FAO/WHO Coordinating Committee for Europe. Accept, Excellency, the assurance of my highest consideration.

####Minimum standards for simultaneous interpretation equipment<sup> 2)  It shall be understood that these standards are for mobile equipment but can also be considered as the strict minimum for fitted installations already built. If any new Conference facility is planned, a copy of International Standard ISO-2603 should be obtained from the International Organization for Standardization.  </sup> 

In cases where the Host Government provides simultaneous interpretation equipment for FAO sessions, conferences or seminars, the following minimum standards will apply: 
###*EQUIPMENT IN THE MEETING HALL*

1. Listening Equipment: Listeners shall be provided with a receiver fitted with a channel selector and volume control, and with a light, comfortable and sensitive headset. The receiver shall include one channel for each language used in the meeting, plus one for the original language, so that participants can listen to a speaker either: 

* directly by selecting the original language channel; or:  

* through interpretation by selecting the appropriate channel.    

2. Speech reinforcement equipment: In the presence of a public address system, its volume control shall be completely independent from that of the simultaneous interpretation system so that lowering the volume of the public address system shall not reduce the sound level supplied to the interpreters through their headsets.  

3. Sound quality: When the conference hall is occupied and the installation is in working order, all the links in the chain “speaker-control box-interpreter’s headsets” must provide the correct reproduction of audio-frequencies between 150 and 12000 Hz.  

4. Microphones: At least one moveable tabletop microphone shall be provided for each 3 participants. The microphone shall incorporate an on/off switch and a clearly visible warning light to show when the microphone is on. If microphones are operated by participants, the microphone circuits shall be arranged so that: 

* not more than one microphone can be on at any given moment;  

* the Chairman’s position is provided with the means of cutting out all other microphones in the hall.   If the microphones are not operated by participants, the control panel shall he placed so that its operator has full visibility of the hall and is close to the interpreters.  

5. Visual Aids: Visual aids for the participants, such as screens or blackboards, shall be positioned so as to be easily visible from the interpreters’ booths.  

6. If there is a podium it should also be fitted with one standing microphone and lectern for formal speeches.  
###*INTERPRETERS' BOOTHS*

7. Dimensions and layout: For dimensions and layout, see sketch on page 4.  

8. Construction and sound insulation: The booths shall be built so as to keep spurious noise transmission between booths and hall to a minimum. Materials should be selected for their soundproofing qualities and should be nonirritating (to eyes, skin and respiratory tract), antistatic and fire-retardant. Walls should be of sandwich construction with a sound-absorbing material between the outer layers. The interior of the booth shall be lined with a sound-absorbing material.  

9. Ventilation/air-conditioning: Adequate ventilation/air-conditioning of the booths is essential. The air should be completely renewed at least 7 times per hour.  

10. Equipment: See sketch on page 4. The control panel shall be fitted with the following controls for each interpreter: 

* Channel selector for listening to the original language and, in relay, to the interpreters from the other booths;  

* Volume control knob;  

* On/off switch for microphone, with warning light to show when microphone is on;  

* Muting key (“cough button”).   A tone control and outgoing channel selection with warning lights are useful and even essential in one or more booths for meetings where Arabic or Chinese is spoken. Example: A meeting with Arabic, English and French. Three booths: Arabic, English and French each equipped with the standard incoming (original language) channel and outgoing (interpretation) channel. In this case, the Arabic booth, in addition to its standard outgoing Arabic interpretation channel, should be wired up so as to have access to the English and French interpretation channels of the system. This will enable the interpreters sitting in the Arabic booth to interpret from Arabic (when Arabic is spoken) into either English or French from their own booths through one or other of these two channels. Each interpreter shall have: 

* a microphone (hand-held microphones are unacceptable).  

* a light (maximum weight 150 grams) comfortable and sensitive headset (stethoscope-type, single-ear type, or types with pads fully enclosing the ears are unacceptable).  

* a desk lamp with on/off switch to light the tabletop (overhead fluorescent tubes are unacceptable).  

* a comfortable chair, preferably height-adjustable.    

11. Location: Booths shall be located so as to afford a complete view of participants, podium and screen or blackboard. If installed on the meeting hall floor, they should be raised about 50 centimetres above floor level. A direct view of the hall is essential: no system using closed-circuit television is acceptable. Booths shall be located away from sources of noise like air-conditioning plants, generators, delegates’ lounge and should be 2 metres clear of the nearest participant.  
###*INTERPRETERS' BOOTH*

###*Rear Elevation*

![10000056787](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000056787)

###*Two typical booth arrangements*

To nearest participant: 2.00 Microphones and lamps should have some form of flexible neck.
###*NOTES*

Windows: double-glazed; front window right across booth; Table: strong enough to take weight of control panel + documents + two interpreters leaning on it: minimum effective depth 0.30; table extends right across booth; Access: Outward opening rear door or heavy curtain; Ventilation: silent roof fan; rear intake vents. ![10000056788](http://wetten.overheid.nl/Illustration/10000056788)
N.B. Care should be taken not to place the booths anywhere that would hinder exit in case of emergency.
