### Nr.  I  

The Hague, July 7, 1970.Sir,I have the honour to refer to the recent conversations held between the Embassy of Mexico and your Ministry on the furtherance of economic relations between our two countries, and, in particular, to the suggestion made in the course of those conversations to create as an important contribution to that purpose, a Joint Mexican-Netherlands Commission for Economic Cooperation, composed of Governmental representatives of high level.It is the understanding of my Government that both parties support that suggestion and are prepared to establish formally the said Commission, in such a way that:

1)The Commission shall promote the relations between Mexico and the Netherlands in economic matters, in particular in the fields of industry, trade, agriculture and transportation, and may propose to that effect any action directed to the intensification of those relations.

2)The members for each meeting of the Commission shall be appointed by the respective Governments, taking into consideration the agenda of the meeting concerned.

3)The Commission shall have an advisory capacity and the viewpoints therein stated, and the decisions the Commission may take, shall be used as reports or recommendations to the two Governments.

4)The Commission shall meet at least once a year, at a date convenient to both Governments, alternately in Mexico City and The Hague.

5)The agenda of each meeting shall be approved at least one month in advance of the meeting, by agreement between the two Governments.

6)The Commission shall maintain at all times close contact with private sector organisms of the two countries, and when the situation so requires, representatives of those organisms may be admitted to the Commission in an advisory capacity.

7)This arrangement can be terminated by each of the parties by means of a written communication to that effect, given six months in advance.I should appreciate it if you would kindly confirm that the foregoing is also the understanding of your Government in order that the Joint Mexican-Netherlands Commission for Economic Cooperation shall be deemed to have been established, under the terms and conditions specified above, in virtue of this letter and the said confirmatory reply.I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to you the assurance of my high consideration.(sd.)
