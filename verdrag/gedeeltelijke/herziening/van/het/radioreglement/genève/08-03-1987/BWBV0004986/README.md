####Final Acts of the World Administrative Radio Conference for the Planning of the HF Bands Allocated to the Broadcasting Service (HFBC-87)

*Geneva, 1987*   

Preamble The World Administrative Radio Conference (Geneva, 1979), considering in its Resolution 508, *inter alia*, that the existing situation in the HF bands allocated exclusively to the broadcasting service is not satisfactory, resolved that the use of the HF bands allocated to the broadcasting service should be subject to planning by a world administrative radio conference to be held in two sessions. The Plenipotentiary Conference (Nairobi, 1982), in its Resolution 1, decided that this Conference should be held in two sessions and made the necessary arrangements. The Administrative Council, at the opening meeting of its 38th session, considered Resolution 508 of the WARC-79 and took the necessary steps to convene the First Session of the World Administrative Radio Conference for the Planning of the HF Bands Allocated to the Broadcasting Service, by adopting Resolution 874. The First Session, which took place in Geneva from 10 January to 11 February 1984, established, in its Report to the Second Session, the technical parameters to be used for planning as well as the principles governing the use of the HF bands allocated exclusively to the broadcasting service. Having adopted an associated method of planning, the First Session requested the IFRB to develop computer programs and test procedures for the preparation of application of the planning method. It also requested the CCIR to continue and complete the complementary studies on certain technical elements. At its 39th session the Administrative Council established the agenda for the Second Session by its Resolution 912; at its 41st session, considering the results of foregoing consultations, it amended that Resolution and resolved that the Second Session be convened in Geneva for five weeks commencing on Monday, 2 February 1987. Consequently, the Second Session of the World Administrative Radio Conference for the Planning of the HF Bands Allocated to the Broadcasting Service was held at Geneva from 2 February to 8 March 1987 and adopted a partial revision of the Radio Regulations, which comprises the following elements:  

|
|
|  *MOD*   |  *Art. 8*   | Frequency Allocations;  |
|  *MOD*   |  *Art. 12*   | Notification and Recording in the Master International Frequency Register of Frequency Assignments to Terrestrial Radiocommunication Stations;  |

|  *MOD*   |  *Art. 30*   | Broadcasting Service and Broadcasting Satellite Service;  |
|  *MOD*   |  *App. 2*   | Submission of Information to the IFRB for High Frequency Broadcasting Requirements;  |

|  *ADD*   |  *App. 45*   | Technical Parameters Relating to the Use of the HF Bands Exclusively Allocated to the Broadcasting Service.  |

The partial revision of the Radio Regulations, as outlined above, shall form an integral part of the latter and shall enter into force on 1 September 1988 at 0001 hours UTC, unless a different date of entry into force is stipulated therein with regard to any element or to a part of any element referred to in the preceding paragraph. The Conference also adopted Resolutions and Recommendations relating to the short- and medium-term programmes of action to be followed to improve the use of the HF bands allocated exclusively to the broadcasting service. The delegates signing this partial revision of the Radio Regulations hereby declare that, should an administration make reservations concerning the application of one or more of the revised provisions of the Radio Regulations, no other administration shall be obliged to observe that provision or those provisions in its relations with that particular administration. Members of the Union shall inform the Secretary-General of their approval of the partial revision of the Radio Regulations by the World Administrative Radio Conference for the Planning of the HF Bands Allocated to the Broadcasting Service (Geneva, 1987). The Secretary-General shall inform Members promptly of the receipt of such notification of approval.   
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the delegates of the Members of the International Telecommunication Union mentioned below have, on behalf of their respective competent authorities, signed one copy of the present Final Acts in the Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish languages. In case of dispute, the French text shall prevail. This copy shall remain deposited in the archives of the Union.
