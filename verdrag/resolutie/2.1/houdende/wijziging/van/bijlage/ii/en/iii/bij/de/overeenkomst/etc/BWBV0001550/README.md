##Resolutie 2.1 houdende wijziging van Bijlage II en III bij de Overeenkomst inzake de bescherming van Afrikaans-Euraziatische trekkende watervogels

### Resolution  2.1  

####Amendments to the Annexes to the Agreement

*Recalling* the Final Act of the negotiation meeting to adopt the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, held in The Hague, the Netherlands, in June 1995, inviting the interim secretariat to prepare amendments to the Action Plan with regard to species or families listed in Annex 2 of the Agreement, *Recalling* Resolution 1.9, adopted at the first Meeting of the Parties in Cape Town, South Africa in November 1999, which amended the Action Plan and requested the Secretariat and/or Technical Committee, interalia: 

(a) To consider addition of species, as specified in the resolution, to the Agreement and Action Plan;  

(b) To review current data on population status;  

(c) To stimulate the preparation of single species action plans.   *Recalling* article X of the Agreement concerning the procedures to amend the Action Plan and its Annexes, *Convinced* that urgent actions are needed for many species not yet included in the Action Plan as adopted at the final negotiating meeting (The Hague, June 1995), and to regularly update the Action Plan, *Having reviewed* document AEWA/MOP2.9, entitled ``Proposed Amendments to the Action Plan", and *having taken note* of the proposed changes to Annex 2 of the Agreement and Table 1 of the Action Plan, which include the following: 

(a) A full update of the conservation status of the species currently listed in the Action Plan, as presented in Table 1a of document AEWA/MOP2.9;  

(b) The inclusion of an additional 11 species and their population status, as specified in Table 1b of AEWA/MOP2.9, in Annex 2 of the Agreement and Table 1 of the Action Plan;  

(c) The inclusion, as requested in Resolution 1.9, of an additional six species, as specified in AEWA/MOP2.9 Table 1c, in Annex 2 of the Agreement and Table 1 of the Action Plan;  

(d) The inclusion, following the specifications in Table 1d of AEWA/MOP2.9, of a further 48 species of waterbirds to Annex 2 of the Agreement and Table 1 of the Action Plan, and the inclusion of an additional 16 migratory populations of 12 species already listed in Annex 2 of the Agreement, to Table 1 of the Action Plan;  

(e) The amendment of the conservation status of the populations of 38 species as proposed in an informal working document ``Further amendments to Table 1 of Action Plan" presented to the Meeting by Wetlands International,   *Noting* the established international process for updating and revision of population estimates and 1 per cent thresholds for waterbirds established by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Wildfowl Habitat, which envisages an update of Wetland International's *Waterbird Population Estimates* being prepared, following international scientific review and consultation, for each triennial Ramsar Conference of the Parties, *Aware* of the considerable practical difficulties that are caused when the timing of the AEWA Meeting of the Parties precedes the publication and endorsement of *Waterbird Population Estimates* by the Ramsar Conventions, *Considering* that the supporting review by AEWA of the status of waterbird populations in the Agreement area would benefit from the inclusion of additional analytical content, inter alia, patterns of changing conservation status by geographic area, by taxonomic and ecological groupings, and by other themes, in particular to act as a high level summary for decision makers and so as to inform directly the revision of the Agreement's implementation priorities,  *The Meeting of the Parties:*

### 3  

*Requests* the Secretariat to monitor the implementation of the amendments and to stimulate the preparation of single- and multi- species action plans for those species identified as having an unfavourable conservation status;  

### 4  

*Noting* apparent declines in the North-west European and Northern European/West Mediterranean populations of *Anas platyrhynchos,* the North-west European population of *Anas acuta*, and the Baltic, Denmark and Netherlands population of *Somateria mollissima*, determines to retain existing categorizations for these populations in Table 1 of the Action Plan, and *calls* upon the Technical Committee, working with Wetlands International and other experts, as a matter of priority, to review further the status of these four populations in the light of additional information, and to report their findings to the Meeting of the Parties at its third session;  

### 5  

*Encourages* Parties to consider, where appropriate, the development and implementation of international multi-species action plans for populations of two or more species listed in column A of Table 1 when those populations share the same habitat (ecosystem), are exposed to similar threats, and require similar measures for their conservation. Priority shall be given to those groups of species which include two or more populations in category 1 in column A of Table 1. Populations of species listed in column B of Table 1 may be included in these action plans if they interact with other species in the group and require similar conservation measures;  

### 6  

*Requests* the Technical Committee of the Agreement, in close cooperation with the Agreement Secretariat and in close consultation with the relevant bodies of the Convention on Migratory Species, to review further development of the Agreement by including additional species of wetland birds and species traditionally considered to be seabirds, looking in the first instance at the species listed in Table 2 and Table 3 of AEWA/MOP2.9, expanding Table 3 to species from the whole of Africa, and considering, in particular, the extent to which the existing Action Plan is adequate in its scope to address differing conservation problems faced by birds of prey, passerines and other taxonomic groups using wetlands;  

### 7  

*Calls* upon the Technical Committee of the Agreement to develop guidelines for the interpretation of the term “significant long-term decline” in the context of Table 1 of the Action Plan;  

### 8  

*Further calls upon* the Technical Committee of the Agreement to provide clarification on the procedures used to delimit bio-geographical populations of waterbirds, noting their significance as practical units for conservation management;  

### 9  

*Takes note* of the second edition of the *Report on the Conservation Status of Migratory Waterbirds in the Agreement Area* (AEWA/Inf.2.14) as the current best available knowledge of the status of populations of waterbirds included in the Agreement;  

### 10  

*Requests* the Technical Committee to develop, at its next meeting, proposals for enhancing the analytical content of the third edition of the AEWA *Report on the Conservation Status of Migratory Waterbirds in the Agreement Area*, and to consider how that information may be used to direct input to future reviews of the Agreement's implementation priorities;  

### 11  

*Takes note also* of *the Report on the Population Status of Lymnocryptes minimus* (AEWA/Inf.2.12), which contains an evaluation of the current data and information on the species;  

### 12  

*Calls upon* all Parties to provide the necessary resources to undertake, on an international level, priority actions such as the drafting of single- and multi-species action plans where most needed on the basis of the amended Action Plan;  

### 13  

*Requests* the Secretariat to liaise with the Ramsar Convention Bureau to endeavour to ensure that in future the timing of the AEWA Meeting of the Parties follows the Ramsar Conference of the Parties, thus facilitating the review of waterbird population estimates by AEWA and further encouraging a globally coordinated and effective process for the review of waterbird population estimates;  

### 14  

*Urges* those countries with waterbird monitoring schemes not supplying data to the International Waterbird Census, to encourage the provision of a regular supply of such information as a matter of priority in order that International Waterbird Census outputs may be based on the most complete assessments possible.
