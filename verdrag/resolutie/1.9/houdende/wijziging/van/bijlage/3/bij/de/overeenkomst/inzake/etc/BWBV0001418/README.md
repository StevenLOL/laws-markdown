*Further adopts* the most recent conservation status of populations as indicated by square brackets in Tables 1 (a) and 1 (b) of AEWA/MOP 1.7, in preference to the conservation status deduced from the second edition of *Waterfowl Population Estimates* (1997) and for reasons outlined in AEWA Inf.1.1;

### 7  

*Calls* on all Parties to provide the necessary resources to undertake priority actions on an international level, e.g., the drafting of single species action plans where these are most needed.
